29,"You can debate no-deal Brexit but next week’s not looking great, says Brexiter in charge of scheduling House of Commons business",29," Jacob Rees-mogg on parliamentary business The Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg has expressed great regret that with such a packed timetable there may not be time to discuss Brexit before Parliament is suspended.  Former Justice Secretary David Gauke has said that next week could be MPs’ only opportunity to challenge a no-deal Brexit.  However, the man whose job it is to arrange business in the House of Commons claims that the agenda is already pretty full of vitally important items.  “Next week you say? Oooh…,” said Jacob Rees-Mogg as he gave the world’s most infuriating smirk. “That’s going to be tricky I’m afraid. Let’s see…  “Monday – oh we’re all still on holiday.  “Tuesday – we get back in the afternoon and then it’s prayers followed by new term drinks and nibbles.  “Wednesday is obviously Prime Minister’s Questions when Boris will waffle incoherently without giving a single sensible answer while we all jeer and laugh condescendingly at each other. Splendid fun!  “Oh, I might be able to fit you in on Thursday morning. Oh no, sorry – that slot has just been filled by one of my colleagues. They want to introduce a heritage Bill to make all police officers say ‘Ullo, ullo, ullo, what’s all this then?’ whenever they turn up at a crime scene.  “As for Friday, well that’s the long-awaited Jaffa Cake Bill – the ‘cake or biscuit’ issue will be debated at length and the final decision enshrined in law once and for all.  “Don’t look at me like that – Jeremy Corbyn tabled that one.”",1
5,"Boris Johnson had already been labelled a disgrace for refusing to resign when the Supreme Court ruled he shut down Parliament illegally. But as MPs returned to work Wednesday, he managed to sink to a new low, invoking the name of a murdered MP in a way that sickened her widower.",5,"   In a fiery debate in the reconvened House of Commons, Labour MP Paula Sheriff called on Johnson to knock off the divisive, inflammatory rhetoric he’s adopted in pushing for Brexit, such as branding legislation intended to prevent a no-deal Brexit a “surrender act.”  Invoking the memory of the late Labour MP Jo Cox, who was murdered a week before the 2016 referendum by a far-right terrorist who yelled “death to traitors,” Sheriff said pro-Remain lawmakers were routinely targeted by extremist Brexiteers who echoed Johnson’s rhetoric of “betrayal” and “surrender” in their threats.  ""We should not resort to using offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language for legislation that we do not like, and we stand here under the shield of our departed friend with many of us in this place subject to death threats and abuse every single day,” said Sheriff, to applause from the Commons.  “We must moderate our language, and it has to come from the prime minister first.""  But if MPs had been looking for an inkling of remorse or self-reflection from Johnson, it wasn’t forthcoming. “I have to say, Mr Speaker, I've never heard such humbug in all my life,” he replied.  READ MORE: Bad news Boris: Supreme Court rules Johnson’s suspension of Parliament was illegal  Instead, the prime minister doubled down on the outrage, when Labour MP Tracy Brabin, who was elected in Cox's seat following her murder, repeated the call for Johnson to moderate his language, “so that we will all feel secure when we're going about our jobs.’  Johnson replied: “The best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and indeed the best way to bring this country together would be, I think, to get Brexit done.”  That comment drew gasps in the House, and a broad wave of condemnation. Cox’s widower, Brendan Cox, tweeted that the use of his late wife’s name made him “feel a bit sick.”  “The best way to honour Jo is for all of us (no matter our views) to stand up for what we believe in, passionately and with determination. But never to demonise the other side and always hold onto what we have in common,” he tweeted, adding that the left’s use of words like “coup” and “fascist” were also inflammatory.  Jo Swinson, leader of the pro-Remain Lib Dems, labelled Johnson’s comments “disgraceful,” and revealed she had been forced to call the police after receiving a death threat that targeted her child.  Labour MP Jess Phillips said that Johnson’s own language — that he would rather be found “dead in a ditch” than fail to bring about Brexit — had been used verbatim in a death threat aimed at her.  Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister, said she felt “disgust” at the prime minister, describing him as “untrustworthy, craven, [with] not a shred of concern for the consequences of his words or actions,” while newspaper the Daily Mirror labelled him the “man with no shame” on its front page.  The storm has rumbled on into Thursday for Johnson, revealing the depth of concern among pro-Remain lawmakers over the threats they have been facing for opposing the government’s strategy to take the country out of the EU by Oct. 31, deal or no deal.  READ MORE: Boris Johnson is so unpopular right now his own brother just quit  Opening the session Thursday, House Speaker John Bercow called on MPs to end the “toxic” culture in Parliament, describing the atmosphere Wednesday as “worse than any I’ve known in my 22 years in the house.”  “Please lower the decibel level and treat each other as opponents rather than enemies,” he said.  Speaking to the BBC Thursday morning, Sheriff said MPs were infuriated by Johnson’s casual dismissal of the consequences of his rhetoric.  “We talk about it in the tearooms. People are really frightened and for him to treat it almost like a joke, was absolutely horrific and demeans the office of prime minister,” she said.  “I believe the prime minister is inciting hatred towards MPs. I understand the importance of saying that, but I know that feeling is shared by many of us.”  Cover: Britain's Prime Minster Boris Johnson leaves 10 Downing Street for Parliament in London, Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2019.

39,﻿Drunken Boris Johnson staggers into Supreme Court and demands trial-by-combat,39,"Boris Johnson at Supreme Court Boris Johnson has shocked everybody by doing something stupendously daft.  The former Honey Monster and current Prime Minister burst into the main chamber of the Supreme Court with a half-empty tin of Special Brew in his hand, demanding that the legality regarding the proroguing of parliament be settled via combat.  “RUFF RAHHHHH!” declared the visibly intoxicated Prime Minister.  “Let’s have it, shall we? Fists, swords or ruddy cricket bats. I don’t care. Trial by combat is the way forward. It’s the only way for a sensible Britain.  “Let’s have me versus Corbyn, winner take all. No holds barred. And so forth.”  Judge Elizabeth King said, “This almost never happens.  “However, we are considering the Prime Minister’s proposal with the utmost degree of seriousness – which is in stark contrast to the consideration we’ve given his previous proposals.  “I mean…a BRIDGE between Scotland and Northern Ireland? Come off it.  “But a fistfight for Brexit between Johnson and Corbyn? I’d pay to see that.”",1
14,"BRUSSELS - A damning UK Supreme Court ruling against British Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week has rekindled discussion within the European Union about another delay to Brexit, with the bloc drawing a line in the sand of mid-2020 at the latest.",14,"   The British parliament resumed on Wednesday after the court ruled that the chamber had been unlawfully suspended by Johnson, who insists he will take Britain out of the EU on Oct.31 - with or without a deal to manage the fallout.But British lawmakers reject the most damaging, no-deal Brexit and, back at work, will now have more chance to upset Johnson's plans.    With the divorce deal stalled, the EU is expecting another delay to Britain's departure date after it was already postponed twice from the original March deadline.    ""We are in favour of an extension if we also see what is the way forward, will there be a general election, a second referendum, will there be a Withdrawal Agreement,"" said Guy Verhofstadt, an EU lawmaker dealing with Brexit.    ""I think that there is unanimity...to say 'OK, let's go forward with an extension if there is a clear path to a solution and unwinding of the situation we have today',"" he told EU lawmakers on Wednesday afternoon.    With a national election expected in Britain by the end of the year, the bloc currently sees that as the most likely justification of anther lag - a decision that would require the unanimity of the 27 states staying on.    The problem is, however, that Britain would need to request such an extension, which Johnson vows never to do and EU Brexit watchers speculate about him possibly stepping aside to let someone else make the step.    Under the law, the EU could also formally demand a delay - which Britain would need to agree to for it to take effect.    But diplomats and officials dealing with Brexit in the bloc's hub Brussels ruled out such a possibility, saying it would risk feeding Johnson's rhetoric about distant elites trying to frustrate the will of the people.    SHORT OR LONG?    With many question marks over the fate of Brexit lingering three years since Britons voted out, EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Oct.17-18 will discuss the desirable length of any such delay.    The British prime minister will not be allowed in the room.    The House of Commons has passed a law demanding that London seeks a postponement until the end of January 2020 to avoid an abrupt split on Oct.31 should no new divorce deal be reached at the EU summit in three weeks time.    ""January may be a bit too soon for us,"" said one EU diplomat. ""It is far from clear that Britain would be able to sort itself out by then and we would risk another summit at the turn of the year to push back another no-deal prospect.""    ""A six-month delay until the end of March might be better for us,"" the person said under condition of anonimity.    Brexit weighs heavily on the EU's work on its next long-term budget from 2021 and several diplomats said there could be no more extensions beyond mid-2020, when the bloc needs to have clarity on whether Britain would go on paying.    ""It could be one long or two shorter ones. Regardless, the cut-off date is in the middle of next year because we need to be able to finalise our own budget in the second half of 2020 at the latest,"" said a senior EU diplomat.    A third diplomat stressed the message: ""We have no problems with extensions as long as they do not impede with us finalising the budget, which must happen in the second half of 2020.""    Another risk for granting Britain an extension next month is the more hawkish stance by French President Emmanuel Macron who, backed by the increasingly expasperated Belgian and Luxembourg leaders, has opposed granting the latest delay until Oct.31.    His camp stresses the cost of protracted uncertainty in terms of sapping the EU's political capital and attention needed to face challenges from climate to migration to international crises, as well as economic cost for companies who have invested in expensive contingency preparations for a no-deal Brexit.    ""This is a nightmare,"" Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel said at the top of his voice in an emotional speech this week that highlighted the EU's growing fatigue with the tortuous process. ""People would love to have clarity.""    Despite that, most EU diplomats and officials currently believe the bloc would grant Britain another Brexit lag - should London request it - to avoid taking the blame for disruptions expected in any no-deal split.    var cont = `Join Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

""I am scared when our house gets fitted with panic buttons... and explosive bags to catch the mail,"" she tweeted.  It comes as the PM was criticised for his words used in Wednesday's debate.  Both Yvette Cooper and Mr Balls - who was an MP until 2015 - responded to Ellie's tweets, saying they were ""proud"" of their daughter.  ""We get used to handling all the things that get thrown at us, but it's harder to see it through your children's eyes,"" she said.  'Perspective of world changed'  In a lengthy Twitter thread posted on Thursday afternoon, Ellie Cooper said the language of Boris Johnson was ""just beyond words"".  She writes: ""I was 17 when Jo Cox was murdered. I just rang my mum, who is Yvette Cooper, on my way home from school to complain about the usual things and I distinctly remember her interrupting me to say 'an MP's been shot.'  ""I can honestly say my perspective of the world completely changed that day.  ""Before then, my mum's job was something that kept her working later than bedtime when I was a kid, the source of embarrassing conversations at school, the reason we travelled to and fro between Yorkshire and London every week for the first two thirds of my life.  ""It was never something that could get her killed.""  She adds: ""I am scared when I scroll through the replies to her tweets calling her a liar and a traitor.  ""I am scared when our house gets fitted with panic buttons, industrial-locking doors and explosive bags to catch the mail.  ""I am scared because on the 16th of June 2016, two children said goodbye to their mother before she left for her constituency to sit in surgeries and help people all day, and never saw her again.

She described the scenes in the House of Commons on Wednesday - which was the first time MPs had returned to Parliament since it was prorogued - as ""chilling"".  The debate descended into rowdiness on Wednesday evening, with several MPs criticising the prime minister for his language and urging him to refrain from using words like ""surrender"".  Mr Johnson had called the legislation which aims to block a no-deal Brexit a ""surrender bill"".  The prime minister has also been urged to apologise for saying the best way to honour Ms Cox - who was killed in Birstall, West Yorkshire in 2016 - was to ""get Brexit done"".  Brendan Cox, the husband of Ms Cox, also said he had been shocked by the language used and the Brexit debate had become a ""bear pit of polarisation"".  Mr Johnson has refused to apologise for his language.  In an interview with the BBC, Mr Johnson defended his words and insisted he ""deplores any threats to anybody, particularly female MPs"" and said ""tempers need to come down"" in Parliament.

0,"Sterling fell on Thursday for a second straight day to near 10-day lows, as investors waited for parliament’s next step to break the Brexit impasse and opposition leaders gathered to discuss tactics.",0," The European Union’s Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said Britain had yet to provide “legal and operational” proposals for an agreement on exiting the bloc at the October 31st deadline .  The UK Supreme Court dealt Prime Minister Boris Johnson a blow on Tuesday when it ruled he had unlawfully suspended parliament. The ruling reinforced belief that Britain was unlikely to leave the EU without a deal on October 31st, but parliament remains split, early elections look inevitable and Johnson remains adamant  Those fears eliminated all sterling’s gains since the Supreme Court ruling, for its biggest one-day fall against the dollar in two weeks. By 0815 GMT, it had slipped 0.14 per cent to $1.2332. It was down 0.1 per cent against the euro at 88.66 pence  “We don’t know where things will go with Brexit. That’s being manifested in sterling more than any other asset,” said Fahad Kamal, chief market strategist at Kleinwort Hambros.  “What we have done in the face of unknowable political outcomes and daily volatility is to make sure our portfolios can deal with any big moves, big rallies or big falls,” he added.  Implied volatility gauges in sterling/dollar – a measure of expected swings in a currency – rose. They had fallen after the court ruling  Chartists see the next big support level for sterling around $1.2280 – the 50-day moving average, a technical indicator that refers to the currency’s average closing price over the past 50 days.  British opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will meet other opposition leaders later in the day, as they discuss how to stop Johnson from quitting the EU on October 31st if he fails to secure a deal with Brussels by October 19th. – Reuters",0
3,Furious Labour MPs have demanded Boris Johnson apologise after he said the 'best way to honour the memory' of Jo Cox is for Parliament to 'get Brexit done' as John Bercow condemned the 'toxic' House of Commons.,3," The Prime Minister had also claimed the 'best way' for MPs to stay 'properly safe' is for them to help him deliver the UK's departure from the European Union on October 31.  Mr Johnson made the comments during a fiery clash in the Commons last night as numerous MPs urged him to tone down his Brexit rhetoric as they suggested it was putting their lives at risk.  This morning Mr Bercow pleaded with MPs on all sides to calm down as he said the atmosphere in the Commons was 'worse than any I've known in my 22 years in the House'.  Meanwhile, Brendan Cox, Jo's widower, said he felt 'a bit sick' after hearing Mr Johnson's remarks and today he was asked how he believed his late wife might have responded.  He said: 'She would have tried to take a generosity of spirit to it and thought about how in this moment you can step back from this growing inferno of rhetoric.'  MPs today launched a bid to force the PM to apologise as they demanded - and were granted - an urgent question in the Commons on his remarks.  But Mr Johnson snubbed the request for him to face a grilling as he sent junior Cabinet Office minister Kevin Foster to answer questions on his behalf.  Mr Johnson chose instead to attend a private meeting of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbench MPs in Parliament.  Despite his absence, Labour MP Jess Phillips led calls for the PM to say sorry as she accused him of 'putting words in my mouth and in the mouth of my dead friend'.  Rachel Johnson, the PM's sister, said her brother's remarks were 'tasteless'.  Last night's debate in the Commons had exploded into acrimony after Mr Johnson appeared to dismiss MPs' safety concerns as 'humbug' as he repeatedly referred to an anti-No Deal law passed by Parliament earlier this month as the 'Surrender Act'.  Opposition MPs responded to Mr Johnson's comments by claiming he has 'no moral compass of any kind' as they claimed he is 'totally unfit for office'.  Members of Mr Johnson's Cabinet also hit out at the remarks as Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan said politicians needed to remember their words had an impact and Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said everyone must be 'mild in our language'.  But James Cleverly, the chairman of the Conservative Party, defended the PM and suggested he had nothing to apologise for.  Boris Johnson, pictured in Downing Street today, responded to concerns about the safety of MPs in the Commons last night by saying 'humbug'  Mr Johnson was told by numerous MPs that they feared for their safety as they urged him to moderate his language  Members of the Cabinet expressed disquiet at what Mr Johnson had said in the Commons  Labour MP Ms Cox was murdered by a far-right terrorist two weeks before the EU referendum in 2016.  MPs tried to drag Mr Johnson to the Commons today to answer questions about what he had said yesterday evening.  Mr Bercow granted an application for an urgent question from Ms Phillips to ask the PM to 'reflect on his language' but Mr Johnson did not attend.  Ms Phillips asked the PM's stand-in Mr Foster to tell him to 'apologise and to tell him that the bravest, strongest thing to say is sorry'.  'It will make him look good, it will not upset the people who want Brexit in this country if he acts for once like a statesman,' she said.  Ms Phillips continued: 'Calling me names, putting words in my mouth and in the mouth of my dead friend makes me cross and angry, it makes me scared even, but I will not react, the Prime Minister wants me to react so I join in the chaos that keeps this hatred and fear on our streets.  John Bercow calls for calm as he urges MPs to 'lower the decibel level' John Bercow pleaded with MPs on all sides to calm down this morning as the fallout continued from Boris Johnson's combative performance in the House of Commons last night. The Commons Speaker said the House 'did itself no credit' in the angry exchanges which followed the Prime Minister's statement on Wednesday night. As MPs returned to the Commons today, Mr Bercow said: 'There was an atmosphere in the chamber worse than any I've known in my 22 years in the House. 'On both sides passions were inflamed, angry words uttered, the culture was toxic.' He told them to 'lower the decibel level and to try to treat each other as opponents, not as enemies'.  'I simply ask the minister... who's notable by his bravery today, I ask him to ask the Prime Minister to meet with me in private with his advisers and some of his colleagues, and my friends from Jo's family so we can explain our grief and try to make him understand why it is so abhorrent that he has chosen a strategy to divide rather than to lead.'  Mr Foster said that 'ultimately it is for everyone to think about what they say and how they have contributed'.  Some Tories have pushed back at the fury expressed by Labour MPs.  Steve Baker, the chairman of the European Research Group of Tory MPs, said: ‘What Boris Johnson has said is entirely defensible and reasonable, but the hypocrisy that is going on here is absolutely rank.  ‘I am a person who has sat through now, over nine years of debates in the House of Commons and in particular opposition day debates and the sheer hysteria and provocation, the pejorative language used by Labour MPs, throughout those opposition day debates, has been a cause of, frankly, despair to me.  ‘I have been insulted, injured, really driven to the depths of sorrow over what they have said, quite unreasonably.'  But Mr Johnson's sister said the remarks made by the PM were 'tasteless' and that repeated references to the 'Surrender Act' were 'highly reprehensible'.  'I think it was a very tasteless way of referring to the memory of a murdered MP,' she told Sky News.  Mr Johnson addressed the Commons last night after Parliament resumed following the Supreme Court's bombshell ruling that his prorogation was unlawful.  There were angry clashes from the start as Mr Johnson refused to apologise for suspending Parliament as he maintained his position that while he respected the court's ruling he disagreed with it.  Anger levels then spiked after Labour MP Paula Sheriff said the PM 'should be absolutely ashamed of himself' over his Brexit rhetoric as she pointed to Ms Cox's commemorative shield which is on the wall in the Commons chamber.  Ms Sheriff said: 'We stand here under the shield of our departed friend. Many of us in this place are subject to death threats and abuse every single day.  'Let me tell the Prime Minister that they often quote his words—Surrender Act, betrayal, traitor—and I, for one, am sick of it.'  She told the PM politicians 'must moderate our language' but he replied: 'I have to say that I have never heard such humbug in all my life.'  He also said the 'best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox, and indeed to bring this country together, would be, I think, to get Brexit done'  And responding to concerns about MPs' safety, he said: 'Believe me: the best way to ensure that every parliamentarian is properly safe and to dial down the current anxiety in this country is to get Brexit done. I hope that he will support us.'  Mr Johnson's comments prompted howls of anger as a number of MPs walked out of the chamber.  Ms Phillips had tweeted last night: 'I'm not scared of an election, I am scared I might be hurt or killed.'  Meanwhile, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson attacked the PM and said that she had just had to report a 'threat against my child' to the police as she said 'we must be able to find a way to conduct ourselves better'.  But the PM's combative performance prompted applause and a standing ovation from many Tory MPs.  Dominic Grieve, the former Tory MP who was stripped of the whip after backing a bid to block a No Deal Brexit, said he found the standing ovation given to Mr Johnson 'terrifying'.  John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, today called for calm as he said last night's debate was the most 'toxic' he could remember  Remainer MPs split over how best to take on Boris Johnson Remainer MPs are at loggerheads over whether they should try to strengthen an anti-No Deal law designed to force Boris Johnson to delay Brexit. Under the so-called Benn Act passed at the start of the month Mr Johnson will have to go to Brussels on October 19 and beg for a three-month Article 50 extension if he has not agreed an exit deal with the EU by then. But with the PM insisting Brexit will still happen on Halloween, with or without a deal, Remainers fear he is preparing to break the law. Some are worried that the current legislation to force his hand might may not be strong enough and want to make it 'bulletproof'. The Lib Dems are leading the charge and want to bring forward new rebel legislation which would force the PM to ask for a delay long before the middle of October - perhaps as early as next week. But 21 ex-Tory MPs who were stripped of the party whip after backing the bid to block No Deal are against tampering with the existing law.  He told ITV: 'I find it terrifying actually. This is somebody who is a pathological liar, one can watch him do it in the chamber of the House of Commons.  'I agree with Jess [Phillips]. He has no moral compass of any kind at all and it was quite deliberate, what he was saying was 'you do as I say and you won't be subject to death threats'.  'That was the impact of that comment. It is total populism.'  Ms Morgan also expressed discontent at Mr Johnson's remarks as she tweeted: 'I know the PM is aware of & sympathetic about the threats far too many of us have received because I shared with him recently the threats I am getting.  'But at a time of strong feelings we all need to remind ourselves of the effect of everything we say on those watching us.'  Mr Rees-Mogg told the Commons after the PM's statement: 'What has happened to other Members, particularly on social media, has been deeply unpleasant and troubling.  'We all have a responsibility to be mild in our language when we are speaking in this House or outside.'  In an unexpected move the Equality and Human Rights Commission weighed into the row this afternoon.  David Isaac, the chairman of the watchdog, said: 'Words have consequences and after the referendum we wrote to all political parties reminding them of the need for respectful debate at all times - no matter how difficult the issues.  'Sadly this has not happened. I urge all our politicians to show the best version of themselves so all views are heard.  'Hard line rhetoric and gestures only serve to create a more polarised society and will not heal the divisions that exist in our country.'  Mr Cox told ITV's Good Morning programme today that the 'tone of our politics is descending into the gutter'.  Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly, pictured arriving in Downing Street this morning, has defended Mr Johnson. Dominic Cummings, pictured heading into Number 10 today, has been accused of plotting a 'People versus Parliament' election campaign  Jo Cox's widower Brendan said he felt 'a bit sick' after Johnson claimed the best way to honour his murdered wife would be to 'get Brexit done'  Kim Leadbeater, Jo Cox's sister, told Sky News this morning that she had been left 'dumbstruck' as she watched last night's debate in the House of Commons  He said: 'It was one of those moments where you're shocked. I have to say I didn't expect Jo's name to be used in that way. It made me feel sick.'  He urged MPs to 'remember what Jo always said which is we do have more in common than that which divides us'.  Ms Cox's sister, Kim Leadbeater, told Sky News that she had been left 'dumbstruck' as she watched the Commons clashes.  'I think the PM needs to think very carefully about the language he uses,' she said.  Mr Cleverly defended Mr Johnson's comments as he denied that the PM labelled Opposition MPs 'traitors'.  'The accusations thrown at him yesterday were deeply unfair,' he said.  'He was accused of calling people traitors - he has never done that.'  Mr Cleverly admitted that Mr Johnson had used the word 'betray' during yesterday's debate.  Diane Abbott, shadow home secretary, said the performance by the Prime Minister in the Commons had put off MPs from offering cross-party support to a Brexit deal.  'I have spoken to people who might want to consider a Boris Johnson deal but that is over,' she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  ",0

During an ill-tempered debate on Wednesday, Mr Johnson was repeatedly challenged by opposition MPs over his use of the term ""surrender bill"" to describe legislation passed earlier this month, which aims to block a no-deal Brexit on 31 October if he fails to come up with a new exit deal with the EU before 19 October.  He dismissed one MP's intervention, in which she both criticised his use of language and mentioned the killing of Ms Cox, as ""humbug"".  Ms Cox, who supported Remain during the referendum campaign, died in 2016 after she was shot and stabbed in Birstall, West Yorkshire.  Her husband Brendan Cox told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had been shocked by the language used in the Commons on Wednesday, saying Brexit debate had become a ""bear pit of polarisation"".  ""I'm not sure that we can look the nation in the eye and say that was a good day.""  That's how a Conservative MP has described the torrid scenes in the Commons in the last 24 hours.  Outrage is a common currency these days, but MPs' jaws dropped as Mr Johnson ramped up the rhetoric in responses to questions - suggesting first that it was ""humbug"" for a Labour MP to demand he temper his language, to try to protect MPs' safety.  Then, he went on to say that the appropriate legacy for the MP who was murdered during the referendum, Jo Cox, was for MPs to complete the Brexit process.  No surprise that Labour MPs howled in protest, some left the Commons in disbelief.  And there may be few Tory MPs willing, as the day goes on, to defend how far he went.  Read Laura's blog in full.  Asking an urgent question in the Commons on Thursday, Ms Phillips said: ""The use of language yesterday and over the past few weeks such as the 'surrender bill', such as invoking the war, such as betrayal and treachery, it has clearly been tested, and workshopped and worked up and entirely designed to inflame hatred and division.""  She added: ""It is not sincere, it is totally planned, it is completely and utterly a strategy designed by somebody to harm and cause hatred in our country.""  Ms Phillips also said: ""When I hear of my friend Jo Cox's murder and the way that it has made me and my colleagues feel, and feel scared, described as humbug, I actually don't feel anger towards the prime minister, I feel pity for those of you who have to toe his line.""

24,Markets rally as Parliament restores Brexit to its normal status of pointless clusterfuck,24," Market rally on Brexit vote The pound rose by 2 cents against the euro following a crucial defeat in the Commons of a government motion that could have endangered the UK’s status as a confused state lurching from crisis to crisis.  City of London stockbroker and champion cocaine user, Simon Williams, was one of many to breathe a sigh of relief when it was announced Britain would once again be in a state of constant disarray.  He explained, “What matters most for investors is predictability. And for the past two years, we have been able to rely on Britain being completely chaotic and devoid of any sense of purpose.”  Mr Williams explained that few of his investor colleagues were worried about a ‘No Deal’ scenario.  “Quite the opposite. For a start, the borders will collapse which means cheaper coke and trafficked sex workers from Belarus which are the two pillars of our profession. And No Deal would actually be quite lucrative for those of us who don’t create jack shit but just gamble other people’s money. We have taken several short positions on the UK going through a catastrophic economic meltdown in the next three years.  “I’ll be honest with you, I thought it was hugely risky but Jacob, a good friend of mine, told me he’d make sure Britain would be out of the G20 by the end of the decade. Lovely chap. A bit old fashioned but if you want to make a few quid from this mess, he’s your man.  “His outfit is based out of Dublin if you’re interested.”",1
18,A defiant Boris Johnson last night vowed that he would not be 'bullied' into moderating his language as his most senior adviser accused MPs facing abuse of bringing it on themselves.,18," The Prime Minister faced a backlash after he repeatedly used the phrase 'Surrender Act' in a Commons debate to describe legislation passed by rebel MPs to block a No Deal Brexit.  But yesterday he pledged to keep using the term as he warned that 'people will feel very badly let down' if the country does not leave the EU on October 31.  The PM's top aide Dominic Cummings last night said MPs should not be surprised about the level of anger directed towards them following the repeated delays to Brexit.  Boris Johnson has refused to be bullied into moderating his language in the House of Commons  118 Church of England archbishops and bishops condemns MPs 'unacceptable' language Every archbishop and bishop in the Church of England has condemned the language used by MPs as ‘unacceptable’. In a joint statement, the 118 members of the College of Bishops said: ‘In the last few days the use of language, both in debates and outside parliament, has been unacceptable. ‘We should speak to others with respect… We should not denigrate, patronise or ignore the honest views of fellow citizens but seek to respect their opinions, their participation in society, and their votes’. The bishops acknowledged they were ‘conscious of the great challenges MPs face’ but urged for ‘respect on all sides amid growing acrimony.’ The Archbishop of Canterbuty, the Most Rev Justin Welby, told The Times: ‘The foundations of our unity and way of life are being challenged. ‘There needs to be a cooling of tempers on all sides in order to enable people to try to come to an agreement to see what solution can unite the country and do what has to be done.’ This is not the first time the church has intervened on Brexit. In August this year, a group of 25 bishops wrote an open letter warning of the dangers of leaving the European Union without a deal. In it signatories, including the Bishop of London and the Bishop of Manchester, said: ‘Our main social and political priority must be to leave well, paying particular attention to the impact of political decisions on those most vulnerable.’  'A lot of people in Parliament are more out of touch with the country now than they were in summer 2016,' he told an event in London. 'If you're a bunch of politicians and you say we are going to respect the result of a democratic vote, and then after you lose you say, 'We don't want to respect that vote', what do you expect to happen?'  Mr Cummings said there was a 'very important distinction' between 'robust political discussion and threats of violence', which he condemned.  'Threats of violence are a completely different matter... everyone should take those extremely seriously,' he added.  Asked whether he believes MPs have themselves to blame for the abuse they are receiving, Mr Cummings replied: 'That's the way you're putting it. I am using my language.'  Mr Johnson faced fury on Wednesday night after he dismissed as 'humbug' a complaint by a Labour MP that his 'inflammatory' rhetoric risked provoking attacks on MPs.  He further angered the opposition by suggesting that the best way to honour murdered Labour MP Jo Cox – an ardent Remainer – was to 'get Brexit done'. Former Tory premier Sir John Major yesterday accused the PM of 'wilfully' destroying the prospects of any cross-party agreement on Brexit with his Commons onslaught.  He said Mr Johnson was whipping up 'fear and anger' for electoral purposes – a tactic he described as 'profoundly un-Conservative'. Mr Johnson defended himself in a round of interviews with BBC regional news programmes, saying: 'I do think in the House of Commons it is important I should be able to talk about the 'Surrender Bill' in the way that I did.  'It would take away the power of this Government and the power of this country to decide how long it would remain in the EU and give that power to the EU. That's really quite an extraordinary thing.'  The PM's top aide Dominic Cummings last night said MPs should not be surprised about the level of anger directed towards them following the repeated delays to Brexit  Mr Johnson said he believes that 'tempers need to come down', but accused opposition MPs of using more abusive terms than him in the Commons chamber.  'I was sitting opposite people who were shouting all sorts of things at me all afternoon that were far harsher,' he said.  'What I worry about is if we don't get Brexit done, then people will feel very badly let down – and that's why we've gotta bash on and get it done on October 31.  'It's only by getting Brexit done that you'll lance the boil...of the current anxiety.'  In a meeting of Tory MPs earlier, Mr Johnson said the party would not be 'bullied' into toning down its language.  Commons Speaker John Bercow yesterday pleaded with MPs on all sides to tackle the 'toxic' political culture  However, Labour MPs have warned the 'horrendous' language about Mrs Cox could scupper Mr Johnson's chances of getting a Brexit deal through Parliament. A number of pro-Leave Labour MPs are known to have been considering voting for any agreement he strikes as they are so worried by the prospect of No Deal. But shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Mr Johnson's performance in the Commons chamber on Wednesday had put off colleagues from offering cross-party support.  'I have spoken to people who might want to consider a Boris Johnson deal but that is over,' she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  Commons Speaker John Bercow yesterday pleaded with MPs on all sides to tackle the 'toxic' political culture.  He said of the angry exchanges on Wednesday evening: 'There was an atmosphere in the chamber worse than any I've known in my 22 years in the House. On both sides passions were inflamed, angry words uttered – the culture was toxic.'",0
30,Crack team of Brexiters to annex Ireland and rename it West Hampshire,30," group of business people A crack team of Brexiters have decided to take radical action to eliminate difficulties surrounding the backstop by annexing Ireland and renaming it West Hampshire.  Frustrated by the Government ignoring a perfectly reasonable petition to invite Ireland to rejoin the United Kingdom, the Brexiters set their plan in motion.  “Well, I had some airmiles left, so I booked some flights into Dublin,” said Simon Williams, bra enthusiast, former boy scout and team leader.  “Trevor’s booked us into a Travelodge which we’ll use as our base camp.”  The group intend to spend a couple of days sewing dissent before they strike.  “We’ll go to some pubs and talk to people about how the EU are all horrible, smelly French people who don’t like bananas and sausages, and that Britain is loads better.”  With the people of Dublin whipped into an anti-EU frenzy, they will then march on the Government, secure the Taoiseach’s resignation, rename the country West Hampshire and fly home.  “We might stop off for a tour of the Croke Park first, and Trevor wants to get a Matchbox Guinness van for his collection, but yes, we should be back by next Thursday and then we can finally achieve our glorious Brexit.”  In a gesture of goodwill to the people of West Hampshire, Mr Williams is prepared to compromise over the country’s new name.  “Oh god, yes, of course. We’re not dictators, if they’d prefer West Wiltshire to West Hampshire then we’ll be fine with that.  “But, I’m sure they’ll just be glad to be rid of that silly foreign name of Eire and have it replaced with something sensible.”",1
19,brexit countdown_bg Created with Sketch.,19," MPs will vote today on whether to allow the Commons to take three days off next week, barely a day after politicians returned to Westminster.  After the furious row over Boris Johnson's overruled attempt to prorogue Parliament, his Government will try to force through a short recess from Monday to Wednesday next week so the Conservative Party Conference can go ahead as planned.  But with a febrile atmosphere in the Commons he faces a difficult task getting it approved.  Mr Johnson is also thought to be plotting a fresh attempt at prorogation that would be legally watertight enough to avoid being overturned in another humiliating court battle.  Why does the Government want a recess?  After the furious row over Boris Johnson's overruled attempt to prorogue Parliament, his Government will try to force through a short recess from Monday to Wednesday next week  In normal times the Commons votes to have a short recess in the autumn to allow the parties' annual conferences to go ahead unimpeded.  Recesses are essentially fixed-length halts in the parliamentary term and take place after a vote by MPs.  It means Ministers and shadow ministers do not find themselves having to be in two places and blocks political chicanery from taking place in the absence of one party.  But these are not normal times. Boris Johnson's plan to prorogue Parliament - call an end to the current session and start another following a Queen's Speech - meant the recess vote never took place.  After the Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that Boris Johnson had acted unlawfully and prorogation was null and void, MPs found themselves back in the Commons with no conference recess agreed.  This was fine for Labour and the Lib Dems, who have had their events already.  But the Conservatives are due to descend on Manchester from Sunday, with Boris Johnson due to address the party faithful on Wednesday.  Without a recess that speech will clash with his appearance at Prime Minister's Questions.  More importantly, ministers fear that opposition parties will use the absence of Tory MPs for political ends - forcing them to come back to London at short notice to answer urgent questions and make statements - or even force votes on Brexit related measures.  The Tories have made clear they will press on with the conference despite the turmoil. The event is a major money-spinner for the party and cancelling would leave a big dent in its finances just months before an expected election.  Commons' Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg last night confirmed that he would seek to force a recess in a vote this afternoon.  Whether it succeeds rests on the attitude of 21 former Tory MPs who lost the whip after voting against the Government but remain Tory party members. If they fall into line it could pass, narrowly.  But how can Boris Johnson prorogue Parliament AGAIN after his court defeat?  Mr Johnson (pictured last night) has made clear that he wants to deliver a fresh Queen's Speech and had previously set a date of October 14.  Boris Johnson is believed to be planning to suspend Parliament again as he tries to hold a Queen's Speech so that his government can set out its domestic legislative agenda.  The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that his five-week suspension of Parliament was unlawful.  But the court did suggest that a shorter prorogation of four or five days would be acceptable.  It said that such a period of time was normal for prorogation purposes.  Downing Street is still examining the court's judgement but there is growing speculation that Number 10 could move to prorogue Parliament again in the coming days.  Any move to suspend Parliament would be massively controversial given that MPs have only just returned to work.  But the government will be hopeful that a shorter prorogation would not fall foul of the courts.  Mr Johnson has made clear that he wants to deliver a fresh Queen's Speech and had previously set a date of October 14.  But the timing of when a prorogation order could be made is yet to be set out.  It is thought that the timing could be impacted by the outcome of the recess vote this afternoon.  If MPs reject the Conservatives' request for the recess it may well act as the trigger for Mr Johnson to try to shut Parliament sooner rather than later.  How will the Remainers try to thwart Boris's Brexit plans?  Rebel MPs are plotting firm action designed to hem in the Prime Minister over Brexit.  But there is an apparent split between the Lib Dems and ex-Tories over whether they should try to strengthen an anti-No Deal law designed to force Boris Johnson to delay Brexit.  Under the so-called Benn Act passed at the start of the month Mr Johnson will have to go to Brussels on October 19 and beg for a three-month Article 50 extension if he has not agreed an exit deal with the EU by then.  But with the PM insisting Brexit will still happen on Halloween, with or without a deal, Remainers fear he is preparing to break the law.  Some are worried that the current legislation to force his hand might may not be strong enough and want to make it 'bulletproof'.  The Lib Dems are leading the charge and want to bring forward new rebel legislation which would force the PM to ask for a delay long before the middle of October - perhaps as early as next week.  But the 21 ex-Tory MPs are against tampering with the existing law. Instead they want to use the time between now and October to hold the Prime Minister's feet to the fire in different ways.  Forcing Boris to ask for Brexit delay from EU with a new law blocking No Deal  Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said yesterday that the Benn Act, an emergency law passed weeks ago forcing Boris Johnson to seek an extension to Article 50, needed strengthening.  It is due to take effect from October 19 if there is no deal in place, mandating an application for a three-month Brexit delay. Government sources have suggested Mr Johnson might try to ignore it.  In a jibe at the Prime Minister following his Supreme Court defeat yesterday Ms Swinson said: 'We simply cannot afford to wait until the 19th of October to see whether or not the Prime Minister will refuse to obey the law again.'  Using Parliamentary rules to take control of the Commons  Ideas floating about include using emergency debate powers to seize control of the order paper, or use a 'humble address' to force the Government to release more Brexit documents.  Some MPs are reportedly planning to try to force the government to publish its prorogation legal advice from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox in full.  The Remain-backing MPs know they have a majority in the Commons and could also try to reinforce the recently passed anti-No Deal law to make it 'bullet proof' amid suggestions the PM could try to ignore it.  Supporters of a so-called 'People's Vote' will be considering whether they could use the shifting balance of power in Westminster to secure their goal.  Labour currently supports a second referendum, but only after an election.  Find Mr Johnson in contempt of Parliament  They could also make moves to find Mr Johnson in contempt of Parliament. Without a majority the PM can in effect do very little to stop them.  Action could be taken against Mr Johnson over his illegal advice to the Queen, with the possibility of contempt proceedings. Theoretically this could include stripping him of his salary - or even imprisoning him at Parliament, although the latter seems very unlikely.  It has also been suggested that MPs could put Theresa May's deal back on the table, but try to attach a 'confirmatory vote' or second referendum.  They could also possibly try to dictate the negotiating strategy of the government, by passing laws instructing them to seek certain terms.  A vote of No Confidence in the Prime Minister  Jeremy Corbyn, pictured on stage in Brighton at Labour conference immediately after the Supreme Court ruling, said Mr Johnson must now 'consider his position'  Such a vote, which could bring down the Government, seems unlikely to be held immediately.  Mr Johnson laid down the gauntlet to opposition parties last night as he said that if any of them wanted to try to topple him then he would make time tomorrow for a vote of no confidence to take place.  That vote would only require a simple majority to succeed and it would then trigger a 14 day period in which another government could be formed.  If no one was able to command a majority in the Commons at the end of that period it would prompt an election to be held after a 25 day campaign period - likely at the end of November.  The responsibility for seeking a vote of no confidence has so far rested with Mr Corbyn as the leader of the opposition, and he has said it will not happen until after the 'threat of No Deal is taken off the table'.  That date that could be as late as October 19, because they want a No Deal Brexit to be ruled out before they push for a vote. A No Confidence vote it could lead to a general election, which sees parliament shut down for five weeks of campaigning, meaning there would be a risk of an accidental hard Brexit if it was triggered too early.  Mr Corbyn said today: 'Until it is very clear that the application will be made, per the legislation, to the EU to extend our membership to at least January, then we will continue pushing for that (blocking No Deal) and that is our priority.'  He added: 'When that has been achieved we will then be ready with a motion of no confidence.'  The vote would almost certainly be tight. Mr Johnson would expect to count on the support of the overwhelming majority of Tory MPs although today's Supreme Court ruling could make some think long and hard about backing the PM.  Mr Johnson would also likely be supported by a number of Labour Brexit-backing MPs as well as the DUP.  On the other side, if Mr Corbyn was to launch a push to get rid of Mr Johnson he would likely only do so if he believed all the other opposition parties were on board.  Lib Dem sources have suggested they could now back a vote of no confidence while the SNP would leap at any opportunity to boot out Mr Johnson.  The parliamentary arithmetic means that the result could ultimately come down to how a group of 21 Tory rebels who were stripped of the whip by the PM after backing the anti-No Deal law would vote.  Block a general election before Brexit Day on October 31  The ruling represents a major set back for Mr Johnson, pictured in New York today, who is now facing calls to resign. He said he believes the court made the wrong decision  The Prime Minister wants to have an election as soon as possible and has tried to call one twice, using the Fixed Term Parliament Act (FTPA), but was voted down by the opposition.  They know they hold the trump card, just as they do on the No Confidence vote, and will strike when it decides the time is right.  Despite spending months demanding a general election Mr Corbyn will delay until a No Deal Brexit is ruled out before acquiescing.  It means the election everyone knows is coming is unlikely to be before November or December, with some in Labour suggesting they could hold off until the spring.  But the 21 Tory rebels DON'T want to play ball. What do they want to do instead?  Meanwhile, the 21 Tory MPs who were stripped of the whip are believed to be opposed to Ms Swinson's proposals.  They reportedly favour leaving the anti-No Deal law as it is and concentrating instead on ramping up the scrutiny of the PM's Brexit plans.  It is thought the 21 former Tories want to use parliamentary procedures and arcane devices to force the government to publish more details of its No Deal contingency planning and to keep the pressure on the PM with urgent questions and debates.  Such methods have proved productive for rebel MPs in the past as they have previously forced the government to hand over Brexit economic impact assessments and No Deal documents.",0
34,Queen to avoid Brexit chaos by applying for German passport,34," Queen in Brexit clusterfuck t-shirt The Queen will be applying for a German passport in order to avoid the potentially harmful consequences of a ‘no-deal’ Brexit according to a Buckingham Palace spokesman.  Palace press attaché Brigadier Tarquin Ftang-Ftang Ponsonby-Psmythe (the second ‘P’ is silent) said that “As one knows, the Queen has German ancestry, which allows her to apply for a German passport so that she may remain an EU citizen.  “She is particularly concerned that a ‘no-deal’ Brexit will not allow her to park the royal yacht ‘HMS Yachty McYachtface’ at her favourite European watering holes such as St. Tropez and Rotterdam.  “By obtaining a German passport the Queen will be able to continue to holiday in style at the British tax-payers expense, without having to queue or apply for any visas.  Upon gaining German citizenship Her Majesty also intends to become Empress of Germany and march upon Britain to force the country back into the EU,” concluded the Brigadier, before adding, “The second ‘P’ is silent by the way. Don’t forget that bit.”  The Queen’s husband Prince Philip will at the same time be applying for a Greek passport thanks to his Greek ancestry, after which he intends to set up a kebab stall on Levkas.",1
36,Theresa May’s latest Brexit deal ‘substantively different’ after being converted to Comic Sans,36," Brexit bill converted to Comic Sans Theresa May has found a way around Speaker John Bercow’s latest, bloody unreasonable demand that the next motion to vote on the Brexit deal should ensure the bill is substantively different from the last.  The new bill is entirely different, having been retyped word-for-word, but this time in Comic Sans font.  “It’s not what we’d hoped for, but then that’s Brexit,” shrugged MP, Simon Williams.  “The documentation also uses the word ‘whatever’ rather more than I’d hoped – in fact, it’s the title of many of the appendices.  “I appreciated the little cartoon of Theresa May throwing a grenade into the EU parliamentary chamber, but I’m not sure how that helps us understand anything. “It’s almost as if this whole thing has been written by someone in a panic, with no real concept of what is required. I did enjoy the dot-to-dot on page 48 though. Turns out it was Boris Johnson thumping a German.”  A spokesperson for the Tory party said, “We worked jolly hard on this, you know.  “You try making a picture of Jean-Claude Juncker entirely out of pasta. We had to send out for more glue.”",1
13,brexit countdown_bg Created with Sketch.,13," MPs have rejected Tory pleas to suspend Parliament for three days at the start of next week to allow the Conservative Party conference to go ahead without disruption.  Furious opposition MPs took their revenge on Boris Johnson as they voted by 306 to 289, a majority of 17, against a short parliamentary recess.  The Tories have said the conference event in Manchester will still go ahead but today's vote raises the prospect of the annual showpiece being majorly disrupted by events back in Westminster.  The government fears that without the recess and with Parliament still sitting, MPs could try to ambush ministers with emergency debates and questions, forcing them to hurry back to London.  One annoyed government source told MailOnline: 'Of course they [opposition MPs] are going to try to cause trouble.'  Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg arriving at a political cabinet meeting in Downing Street tonight  The meeting was also attended by Chancellor Sajid Javid (left) and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab (right)  Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock (right) with Paymaster General Oliver Dowden outside Number 10  Boris Johnson gathered senior ministers for a meeting of his political Cabinet this evening in Downing Street.  A senior Conservative source said they has agreed that the vote result 'would not interfere' with the event in Manchester.  'They agreed that conference is an important occasion for members and a lot of Manchester businesses were reliant on the event taking place in its full format,' the said.  'Cabinet agreed that conference should address the public’s biggest concern of getting Brexit done to allow Government to deliver on people’s domestic priorities.'  Another government source said blocking recess was a 'deliberate and cynical act' and was 'another example of this Parliament being broken'.  Meanwhile, MPs' refusal to give the Tories time off could push Boris Johnson towards trying again to prorogue Parliament.  The PM has made clear that he wants to end this parliamentary session so that his new government can set out its domestic legislative agenda in a Queen's Speech.  Mr Johnson is likely to be incensed by the defeat and the prospect of MPs trying to disrupt his party's conference and it could prompt him to push the nuclear button for a second time.  There are rumours swirling in Westminster this afternoon that the PM could prorogue Parliament within days but the decision would only be made public after Mr Johnson had secured the Queen's backing.  The Supreme Court ruled earlier this week that Mr Johnson's original five-week prorogation was unlawful but it is thought a shorter suspension would be within the boundaries of the law.  The vote this afternoon came after Mr Johnson vowed to carry on referring to an anti-No Deal law as the 'Surrender Act' despite a wave of criticism as he continued to lay the groundwork for a 'People versus Parliament' general election campaign.  Mr Johnson told a meeting of the influential 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs today that he had no intention of watering down his description of the rebel legislation.  He was rebuked by Commons Speaker John Bercow last night for repeatedly referring to the so-called Benn Act as the 'Surrender Act', prompting howls of derision from opposition MPs.  But Mr Johnson reportedly told his backbenchers that ‘they [Labour] are trying to drive us off the word surrender because they know it is cutting through’.  MPs today voted 306 to 289 against going ahead with a three day recess at the start of next week in a move which represents a major headache for the Conservative Party conference  The Prime Minister (pictured in Downing Street today) told MPs last night he intends to press ahead with a Queen's speech in the coming weeks in order to bring forward a new agenda of domestic policies  The Prime Minister was swiftly followed by his aide Dominic Cummings. The PM has faced calls to sack Mr Cummings following the Supreme Court bombshell  What does today's vote against recess mean for prorogation? A recess to allow party conferences to take place has been a standard part of the parliamentary calendar for many years. By rejecting a request for a three day break at the start of next week, opposition MPs have seemingly torn up convention. The move means the Conservative Party conference in Manchester will have to take place while Parliament is sitting. That means the government could be ambushed by MPs demanding urgent questions and debates which could force ministers to have to hurry back to Westminster. It is an incendiary move and will cause anger in Downing Street. Boris Johnson is believed to be considering trying to prorogue Parliament again in order to hold a Queen's Speech. The fact that he has just lost his seventh vote out of seven since becoming PM may well accelerate such a suspension because now more than ever the government needs a clean slate. There are rumours swirling in Westminster this afternoon that the PM could prorogue Parliament within days but the decision would only be made public after Mr Johnson had secured the Queen's backing.  The PM's decision to recommit to using the phrase will cause uproar among Remain-backing MPs who believe his rhetoric is putting their safety in jeopardy.  Conservative MPs cheered and banged on tables as the Prime Minister arrived for the meeting in Parliament today as the premier continues to prepare his troops for an election he has long demanded and which could take place by the end of the year.  MPs said after the meeting had finished that the PM had been 'ebullient’ and ‘full of bonhomie’ despite being under-fire from his critics.  Last night he dared opposition leaders to bring forward a vote of no confidence to try to topple him and trigger a snap poll.  But all of them said they will only try to get rid of him once a No Deal Brexit has been ruled out.  Despite the set back for Mr Johnson, Downing Street remains convinced that there will be a snap election sooner rather than later.  As a result Number 10 is now moving into full campaign mode with Mr Johnson ramping up his attacks on Remainer MPs amid growing speculation he could try to prorogue Parliament again.  However, Mr Johnson is today facing a huge backlash after last night telling MPs that the best way to honour Jo Cox, a Labour MP who was murdered by a far-right terrorist, was to deliver Brexit.  He also appeared to dismiss MPs' claims that incendiary language was putting their lives at risk.  Rudd leads Remainer ex-Tories against Boris Johnson in recess vote Former home secretary Amber Rudd led a hardcore group of ex-Tories who voted against the government over recess today. The Hastings MP was joined in the No lobby by a hardcore of Conservative Remainers including former chancellor Ken Clarke, Theresa May's justice secretary David Gauke, ex-education secretary Justine Greening and Dominic Grieve, who was once attorney general. They had the whip removed by Mr Johnson earlier this month after voting to block a No Deal Brexit. But several others backed the PM today, including ex-Tory ministers Greg Clark, Caroline Nokes and Steve Brine. Ten current Tories, including Dame Caroline Spelman, the former party chairwoman, and ex-Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley, did not vote.  In a sign of the worsening relations in the Commons, MPs this afternoon voted against giving the Tories a conference recess despite the fact that such breaks in the parliamentary calendar are a long-held convention.  The Tories said their conference will still go ahead but it is likely some events may have to be re-arranged.  Mr Johnson is due to address the conference on Wednesday and a Tory source told the Huffington Post that plan had not changed.  That raises the prospect of Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary and First Secretary of State, being asked to step in to cover for Mr Johnson at PMQs.  The government was defeated in today's vote at least in part because a number of former Tory MPs who were stripped of the whip or quit over Brexit voted against Mr Johnson.  Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Dominic Grieve were among the ex-Conservatives to vote with the opposition.  A Tory source said: 'This was an attempt to deliberately undermine an event for party members. That is not the act of MPs who value the hard work of party members and activists.'  The government is worried that without a recess opposition MPs will wreak havoc by triggering crunch votes in the Commons, forcing ministers and Conservative backbenchers to have to shuttle to and from Manchester.  Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Commons Leader, said after the vote result was announced that the government would table seemingly non-offensive and non-political business to be debated at the start of next week in an apparent bid to stop disruption.  However, with the Tories' request for a recess on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday rejected, there are no guarantees that MPs will not try to embarrass the government.  Today's defeat in the Commons was Mr Johnson's seventh in a row since he became PM.  The Prime Minister suggested yesterday that he is drawing up plans to try to prorogue Parliament again.  Can Boris Johnson try to prorogue Parliament again? Boris Johnson is believed to be planning to suspend Parliament again as he tries to hold a Queen's Speech so that his government can set out its domestic legislative agenda. The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that his five-week suspension of Parliament was unlawful. But the court did suggest that a shorter prorogation of four or five days would be acceptable. It said that such a period of time was normal for prorogation purposes. Downing Street is still examining the court's judgement but there is growing speculation that Number 10 could move to prorogue Parliament again in the coming days. Any move to suspend Parliament would be massively controversial given that MPs have only just returned to work. But the government will be hopeful that a shorter prorogation would not fall foul of the courts. Mr Johnson has made clear that he wants to deliver a fresh Queen's Speech and had previously set a date of October 14. But the timing of when a prorogation order could be made is yet to be set out.  The rejection of the proposed recess could well accelerate those plans.  The Supreme Court ruled earlier this week that Mr Johnson's five week prorogation of Parliament was unlawful.  But the PM has said he still wants to hold a Queen's Speech so that he can set out a new domestic legislative agenda.  That raises the prospect of the PM trying to suspend Parliament for a shorter period of perhaps a week in a move which will spark anger among Remainer MPs who will argue they have only just got back to work.  Mr Johnson yesterday brushed aside demands for him to apologise over his failed prorogation as he recommitted to holding a Queen's Speech.  He said: 'I think we need a Queen's Speech. We have a dynamic domestic agenda.'  Asked when he might move to trigger another suspension, Mr Johnson said: 'I will be informing [MPs] as soon as we have assessed the meaning of the court's ruling.'  Speaking on ITV's Peston show last night, Mr Johnson confirmed he was undeterred by the Supreme Court's bombshell unanimous ruling.  He said: 'I think the public should see what we want to do and I think it's a great shame that the opposition are sort of gridlocked.  'They don't want either to have an election. They don't want Brexit to get done. They don't seem to want anything.  'So my urging them would be: if you seriously don't want to have an election, then let's get on with a strong domestic agenda of the kind we have.'  Mr Johnson had challenged opposition MPs to bring forward a vote of no confidence last night as he said he would make time available for a division if any party wanted to try to get rid of him.  But none of the other parties took the bait.  Downing Street said that if MPs did not try to oust the PM then he would take that as a sign that Parliament does in fact have confidence in him and his Brexit strategy.  Number 10 said if no confidence vote was tabled then Mr Johnson would determine that he has a mandate from MPs to carry on as he sees fit.  The remarks were widely interpreted as a signal that the Prime Minister will try to prorogue Parliament again.  The row over recess came as Mr Johnson faced sustained calls to apologise after he said the 'best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox, and indeed to bring this country together, would be, I think, to get Brexit done'.  He also dismissed as 'humbug' claims made by Labour MP Paula Sherriff that the 'pejorative language' he has used on Brexit was putting the safety of parliamentarians at risk.  Ms Sheriff said all politicians needed to 'moderate our language' as she pointed to Ms Cox's commemorative shield on the wall in the House of Commons.  But Mr Johnson replied: 'I have to say that I have never heard such humbug in all my life.'  Brendan Cox, Jo's widower, said he felt 'a bit sick' after hearing Mr Jonson's remarks.  What will Boris Johnson do next? PM wants to SHUT DOWN Parliament just days after reopening its doors as he ponders attempt to prorogue it AGAIN but MPs vow to block his an attempt to hold an uninterrupted Tory conference next week  MPs today voted against a three day recess to allow the Conservative Party conference to go ahead as planned next week.  The decision by MPs to block the brief recess has sparked anger in the government because it means the Tories will have to meet in Manchester while Parliament continues to sit.  Meanwhile, today's vote could prompt Boris Johnson to accelerate plans to try again to prorogue Parliament.  Here are the answers to all of the key questions arising from another chaotic day in British politics.  Why does the Government want a recess?  After the furious row over Boris Johnson's overruled attempt to prorogue Parliament, his Government will try to force through a short recess from Monday to Wednesday next week  In normal times the Commons votes to have a short recess in the autumn to allow the parties' annual conferences to go ahead unimpeded.  Recesses are essentially fixed-length halts in the parliamentary term and take place after a vote by MPs.  It means Ministers and shadow ministers do not find themselves having to be in two places and blocks political chicanery from taking place in the absence of one party.  But these are not normal times. Boris Johnson's plan to prorogue Parliament - call an end to the current session and start another following a Queen's Speech - meant the recess vote never took place.  After the Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that Boris Johnson had acted unlawfully and prorogation was null and void, MPs found themselves back in the Commons with no conference recess agreed.  This was fine for Labour and the Lib Dems, who have had their events already.  But the Conservatives are due to descend on Manchester from Sunday, with Boris Johnson due to address the party faithful on Wednesday.  Without a recess that speech will clash with his appearance at Prime Minister's Questions.  More importantly, ministers fear that opposition parties will use the absence of Tory MPs for political ends - forcing them to come back to London at short notice to answer urgent questions and make statements - or even force votes on Brexit related measures.  The Tories have made clear they will press on with the conference despite the turmoil. The event is a major money-spinner for the party and cancelling would leave a big dent in its finances just months before an expected election.  Commons' Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg last night confirmed that he would seek to force a recess in a vote this afternoon.  Whether it succeeds rests on the attitude of 21 former Tory MPs who lost the whip after voting against the Government but remain Tory party members. If they fall into line it could pass, narrowly.  But how can Boris Johnson prorogue Parliament AGAIN after his court defeat?  Mr Johnson (pictured last night) has made clear that he wants to deliver a fresh Queen's Speech and had previously set a date of October 14.  Boris Johnson is believed to be planning to suspend Parliament again as he tries to hold a Queen's Speech so that his government can set out its domestic legislative agenda.  The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that his five-week suspension of Parliament was unlawful.  But the court did suggest that a shorter prorogation of four or five days would be acceptable.  It said that such a period of time was normal for prorogation purposes.  Downing Street is still examining the court's judgement but there is growing speculation that Number 10 could move to prorogue Parliament again in the coming days.  Any move to suspend Parliament would be massively controversial given that MPs have only just returned to work.  But the government will be hopeful that a shorter prorogation would not fall foul of the courts.  Mr Johnson has made clear that he wants to deliver a fresh Queen's Speech and had previously set a date of October 14.  But the timing of when a prorogation order could be made is yet to be set out.  It is thought that the timing could be impacted by the outcome of the recess vote this afternoon.  If MPs reject the Conservatives' request for the recess it may well act as the trigger for Mr Johnson to try to shut Parliament sooner rather than later.  How will the Remainers try to thwart Boris's Brexit plans?  Rebel MPs are plotting firm action designed to hem in the Prime Minister over Brexit.  But there is an apparent split between the Lib Dems and ex-Tories over whether they should try to strengthen an anti-No Deal law designed to force Boris Johnson to delay Brexit.  Under the so-called Benn Act passed at the start of the month Mr Johnson will have to go to Brussels on October 19 and beg for a three-month Article 50 extension if he has not agreed an exit deal with the EU by then.  But with the PM insisting Brexit will still happen on Halloween, with or without a deal, Remainers fear he is preparing to break the law.  Some are worried that the current legislation to force his hand might may not be strong enough and want to make it 'bulletproof'.  The Lib Dems are leading the charge and want to bring forward new rebel legislation which would force the PM to ask for a delay long before the middle of October - perhaps as early as next week.  But the 21 ex-Tory MPs are against tampering with the existing law. Instead they want to use the time between now and October to hold the Prime Minister's feet to the fire in different ways.  Forcing Boris to ask for Brexit delay from EU with a new law blocking No Deal  Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said yesterday that the Benn Act, an emergency law passed weeks ago forcing Boris Johnson to seek an extension to Article 50, needed strengthening.  It is due to take effect from October 19 if there is no deal in place, mandating an application for a three-month Brexit delay. Government sources have suggested Mr Johnson might try to ignore it.  In a jibe at the Prime Minister following his Supreme Court defeat yesterday Ms Swinson said: 'We simply cannot afford to wait until the 19th of October to see whether or not the Prime Minister will refuse to obey the law again.'  Using Parliamentary rules to take control of the Commons  Ideas floating about include using emergency debate powers to seize control of the order paper, or use a 'humble address' to force the Government to release more Brexit documents.  Some MPs are reportedly planning to try to force the government to publish its prorogation legal advice from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox in full.  The Remain-backing MPs know they have a majority in the Commons and could also try to reinforce the recently passed anti-No Deal law to make it 'bullet proof' amid suggestions the PM could try to ignore it.  Supporters of a so-called 'People's Vote' will be considering whether they could use the shifting balance of power in Westminster to secure their goal.  Labour currently supports a second referendum, but only after an election.  Find Mr Johnson in contempt of Parliament  They could also make moves to find Mr Johnson in contempt of Parliament. Without a majority the PM can in effect do very little to stop them.  Action could be taken against Mr Johnson over his illegal advice to the Queen, with the possibility of contempt proceedings. Theoretically this could include stripping him of his salary - or even imprisoning him at Parliament, although the latter seems very unlikely.  It has also been suggested that MPs could put Theresa May's deal back on the table, but try to attach a 'confirmatory vote' or second referendum.  They could also possibly try to dictate the negotiating strategy of the government, by passing laws instructing them to seek certain terms.  A vote of No Confidence in the Prime Minister  Jeremy Corbyn, pictured on stage in Brighton at Labour conference immediately after the Supreme Court ruling, said Mr Johnson must now 'consider his position'  Such a vote, which could bring down the Government, seems unlikely to be held immediately.  Mr Johnson laid down the gauntlet to opposition parties last night as he said that if any of them wanted to try to topple him then he would make time tomorrow for a vote of no confidence to take place.  That vote would only require a simple majority to succeed and it would then trigger a 14 day period in which another government could be formed.  If no one was able to command a majority in the Commons at the end of that period it would prompt an election to be held after a 25 day campaign period - likely at the end of November.  The responsibility for seeking a vote of no confidence has so far rested with Mr Corbyn as the leader of the opposition, and he has said it will not happen until after the 'threat of No Deal is taken off the table'.  That date that could be as late as October 19, because they want a No Deal Brexit to be ruled out before they push for a vote. A No Confidence vote it could lead to a general election, which sees parliament shut down for five weeks of campaigning, meaning there would be a risk of an accidental hard Brexit if it was triggered too early.  Mr Corbyn said today: 'Until it is very clear that the application will be made, per the legislation, to the EU to extend our membership to at least January, then we will continue pushing for that (blocking No Deal) and that is our priority.'  He added: 'When that has been achieved we will then be ready with a motion of no confidence.'  The vote would almost certainly be tight. Mr Johnson would expect to count on the support of the overwhelming majority of Tory MPs although today's Supreme Court ruling could make some think long and hard about backing the PM.  Mr Johnson would also likely be supported by a number of Labour Brexit-backing MPs as well as the DUP.  On the other side, if Mr Corbyn was to launch a push to get rid of Mr Johnson he would likely only do so if he believed all the other opposition parties were on board.  Lib Dem sources have suggested they could now back a vote of no confidence while the SNP would leap at any opportunity to boot out Mr Johnson.  The parliamentary arithmetic means that the result could ultimately come down to how a group of 21 Tory rebels who were stripped of the whip by the PM after backing the anti-No Deal law would vote.  Block a general election before Brexit Day on October 31  The ruling represents a major set back for Mr Johnson, pictured in New York today, who is now facing calls to resign. He said he believes the court made the wrong decision  The Prime Minister wants to have an election as soon as possible and has tried to call one twice, using the Fixed Term Parliament Act (FTPA), but was voted down by the opposition.  They know they hold the trump card, just as they do on the No Confidence vote, and will strike when it decides the time is right.  Despite spending months demanding a general election Mr Corbyn will delay until a No Deal Brexit is ruled out before acquiescing.  It means the election everyone knows is coming is unlikely to be before November or December, with some in Labour suggesting they could hold off until the spring.  But the 21 Tory rebels DON'T want to play ball. What do they want to do instead?  Meanwhile, the 21 Tory MPs who were stripped of the whip are believed to be opposed to Ms Swinson's proposals.  They reportedly favour leaving the anti-No Deal law as it is and concentrating instead on ramping up the scrutiny of the PM's Brexit plans.  It is thought the 21 former Tories want to use parliamentary procedures and arcane devices to force the government to publish more details of its No Deal contingency planning and to keep the pressure on the PM with urgent questions and debates.  Such methods have proved productive for rebel MPs in the past as they have previously forced the government to hand over Brexit economic impact assessments and No Deal documents.",0
37,"I will deliver Brexit by thoroughly pissing off the people who will carry it out, says Boris Johnson",37," Boris Johnson and the civil service Boris Johnson has taken a vital first step in the process of leaving the EU by completely alienating the staff he will depend on to get anything done, should he get into Downing Street.  Simon Williams MP, a gout-afflicted cretin that support Boris Johnson, explained that enraging the people who know every little dirty secret and control all the machinery of government was a brilliant tactical play.  He went on, “The highly professional global network created by the FCO over decades will be essential to obtain the trade deals and political concessions the UK will need if it wants to still be in the G20 this time next year.  “That’s why wily Boris has shown the diplomats who run this network that he will trash their career just to get a thumbs up from a thin-skinned sexual predator.  “A little kick up the backside for the Sir Humphreys out there. It’s not like they have any way of retaliating. Because if there’s one person who has nothing to worry about from government leaks, it’s Boris.”  Many people on the left were also rejoicing at the new dynamics between the Tory leadership and Whitehall, as explained Amanda Tinnock, political editor for the Guardian newspaper.  “I think we are going to enter a golden age of open government when Boris becomes PM. I suspect every single tiny fuck-up and tawdry detail will somehow find its way to a front-page within hours.  “Even better, since Boris couldn’t organise a piss up in a brewery, if the mandarins don’t play along then Brexit is fucked.”",1
21,"Theresa May ‘stuck in a time loop’, being forced to make the same Brexit offer over and over again",21," Theresa May Groundhog day Theresa May keeps waking up to find Parliament is forcing her to make the same Brexit offer every day.  So far Theresa has tried thousands of different ways to break the loop, including standing parliament in front of an oncoming train, trying to kill Boris Johnson and David Davis’ careers, and loading her and Jeremy Corbyn into the same vehicle and driving them off a cliff.  However, when she wakes up, she finds exactly the same story about deadlock on the Today Programme all over again.  “She’s going to have to keep doing this until she gets the perfect Brexit or forever, whichever comes first,” we were told.  ”We’re not sure how she came to be in this situation – possibly she was cursed by some villainous, pencilnecked Victorian wizard, or maybe she’s just been asked to achieve the impossible and reconcile at least six contradictory points of view.  “Having to keep telling John Humphries the same thing over and again despite knowing it’s futile must be some sort of personal hell.”  When asked how negotiations are going, Theresa May replied “I’ll give you a Brexit prediction. It’s going to be cold, it’s going to be grey & it’s going to last you the rest of your life.”",1
23,Boris Johnson faces his greatest humiliation for a couple of hours,23," Boris Johnson It is understood that embattled Prime Minister Boris Johnson will face his greatest humiliation for a couple of hours or so when Parliament votes to take control of business later today.  It comes in the wake of having his prorogation of Parliament ruled illegal, his trousers falling down and taking a cream pie to the face.  Mr Johnson responded robustly to the prospect of ever-greater humiliation.  “If there is one thing my few short months as Prime Minister has taught me,” he said, shortly after loudly breaking wind whilst there was a pause in the conversation.  “It’s how to handle a constant and unrelenting stream of abject humiliation on both domestic and foreign stages.”  Pausing briefly to wipe off the pigeon excrement that had just landed in his hair, Mr Johnson waved to someone who he thought was waving at him but was actually waving at someone else, then got in his car which promptly let out a loud bang and cloud of smoke from the exhaust pipe before all four wheels fell off.  The Prime Minister will return to Parliament at some point today, shortly after standing on a series of rakes which cause the handles to whack him in the face repeatedly.",1
10,Boris Johnson told his ministers yesterday that the Tories are on course for election victory.,10," His message came as Jeremy Corbyn finally signalled that he would agree to go to the polls this year.  The Prime Minister told his Cabinet that the strategy is to target 50 marginal seats and defend another 50, aiming for a 'functional majority' in the House of Commons.  Boris Johnson told his ministers yesterday that the Tories are on course for election victory  He said the slogan for next week's Conservative conference will be: Get Brexit done.  Mr Johnson warned hardline Brexiteers – known as the Spartans – who have refused to vote for a deal that they would not get everything they want, saying: 'Even the Spartans are going to have to compromise.'  Internal polling shows that the Prime Minister is 'miles ahead on leadership and the numbers are moving in the right direction', ministers were told, while Tory sources said this month had been the best ever for fundraising.  One Cabinet minister said: 'Labour must have the same numbers which is why they're running scared from election.'  Mr Corbyn has committed to whip Labour MPs to vote for a general election once a Brexit extension is secured from the EU.  He also pledged further parliamentary action to ensure Mr Johnson requests a delay to Brexit, as demanded by the 'Benn Act' passed by opposition parties and rebel former Tory MPs.  His message came as Jeremy Corbyn finally signalled that he would agree to go to the polls this year  In an interview, Mr Corbyn said: 'It's not a matter of choice for him, it's an Act of Parliament that was passed.'  Pressed on whether he would whip his MPs to vote for an election the moment a Brexit extension is agreed, the Labour leader said: 'Absolutely.'  Asked if this would mean an election this year, Mr Corbyn agreed that it would.  Many Labour MPs, including deputy leader Tom Watson, have called for a second Brexit referendum to be held before any election.  Last night, former prime minister Sir John Major warned that the election will be bitter and wounding.  In a speech to the Centre for European Reform, he said: 'In the present atmosphere it would be likely to become the most unsavoury election of modern times. All parties profess to believe an election is necessary to clear the air.  Last night, former prime minister Sir John Major warned that the election will be bitter and wounding  'I disagree. Until Brexit is resolved, a general election would solve nothing. It would merely fuel the current feeling of disillusionment and disunity.  'Far from healing the nation, it would scratch away at open wounds.  'It may also be pointless, as the most likely outcome is another fragmented Parliament, even more bitterly divided than it is now.'",0
31,EU to grant year-long Brexit extension to give Britain the time to fully tear itself apart,31," Donald Tusk The EU is expected to grant the UK a year-long extension to Article 50 to allow time for the country to completely tear itself apart.  Prime Minister Theresa May had requested a short extension until late next month, but the EU seems unconvinced that would be enough time for Britain to completely implode.  The ERG responded furiously.  “This is typical of a tyrannical European superstate,” frothed whichever of the revolving door of red-faced maniacs is currently facing the challenge of stringing a coherent sentence together.  “We don’t need their year-long so-called extension!  “A month is more than enough time for this country to rip itself to shreds, and we can do it without the interference of Brussels, Thank you very much.  “The British people could tear themselves apart in an afternoon, given the opportunity. How dare the Europeans suggest it might take us longer than that.”  However, the EU has insisted that it sees the situation quite differently.  “It is clear that our friends in Britain need a little more time to bring their absurd, dysfunctional government to a complete standstill and take to the streets in an orgy of violence and retribution,” explained a sad Donald Tusk.  “Therefore, we will grant the extension for a full year. If, of course, the country reaches complete societal breakdown before then, that is good also.”  It is understood that The Prime Minister will make a comment to the press as soon as someone has explained to her what the EU is letting her country do next.",1
32,Man sent into furious tailspin by Extinction Rebellion adamant he will cope fine with No Deal Brexit,32," Man upset at extinction rebellion A red-faced man who has been apoplectic since his commute was slightly lengthened due to the actions of Extinction Rebellion sees no contradiction with his claims that he could shrug off any minor hardships brought about by a No Deal exit from the EU.  Simon Williams, a Docklands estate agent who lives in Croydon, has been incessantly railing about how being forced to reroute on Thursday morning was nothing less than a mortal threat to his ability to feed his family.  Paradoxically, Mr Williams has also been telling people around him that any disruption to transport, food chains, financial transactions or medical supplies due to the country engaging in a no-deal Brexit would be easily coped with, because his grandparents had survived the war.  He explained “These middle-class virtue signallers are taking food out of my children’s mouths by making me slightly late for work. We need to crack down on them before they bring the country to its knees.  “I’m all for the freedom to protest but how many times will they force me to leave my home slightly earlier than usual? It sounds harsh but I think we need to use the army.”  However, Mr Williams was much more phlegmatic when asked how he felt the UK should deal with Brexit.  He explained, “We should just go. No deal, no fuss. We’ll be fine. My Grandad was an anti-aircraft gunner in the War. He survived the Blitz and rationing which means I have too, in a way. We just need to rely on British pluck and that will see us through.”  Mr Williams then interrupted the interview to scream at a parcel delivery driver who had ‘ruined everything’ after leaving a package out in the rain.",1
25,Nigel Farage’s Brexit march proves nation cares more about Brackley Town vs Curzon Ashton than Brexit,25," March for Brexit Nigel Farage The people of Britain have spoken and made it clear that the result of Brackley Town vs Curzon Ashton is twice as important to them than any potential threat to Brexit.  Despite Nigel Farage’s march managing to secure the support and attendance of 0.0003% of the population, more than twice as many people attended Brackley’s home match against Curzon Ashton in the National League North division, with 450 turning out to show important it was.  Brackley secured a 2-0 victory in front of 250 more people than attended the start of Nigel Farage’s march, in the starkest illustration so far that Brexit no longer matters to anyone.  Farage himself spoke of the numbers, telling reporters, “What you have to remember is there would have been a million people here – like there was for the people’s vote march in London – if only the roads hadn’t been so busy due to immigration.  “Hard-working Brits who wanted to come out and support us today were unable to do so because of the Bulgarian plumber round the corner who keeps stealing their petrol money.  “Whereas the million people who turned up to support a people’s vote in London all had their petrol money paid for by George Soros, so it was easy for them.”  Reporters sent to cover the Brexit march said they were a little disappointed, given Nigel Farage had been pushing the event very heavily on social media.  As one TV reporter told us, “He said it would be the biggest protest in history, but there was a bigger queue outside my local Tesco when they made Heineken half-price just before Christmas.  “I’m not going to suggest that nobody cares about Brexit anymore, because that’s probably too big a leap, but people clearly don’t care what Nigel Farage says about Brexit any more.  “And no, of course he’s not doing the march himself. Have you learned nothing from this man in the last few years?”",1
12,Dame Margaret Beckett has declared she is willing to serve as a caretaker prime minister to stop Britain leaving the EU without a deal on October 31.,12," The Labour former foreign secretary has emerged as a leading choice among those plotting a government of national unity that would ask for a Brexit extension and then call a referendum or election.  MPs who want to stop a No Deal Brexit are considering ousting Boris Johnson from Downing Street through a vote of no confidence.  Dame Margaret Beckett has declared she is willing to serve as a caretaker prime minister to stop Britain leaving the EU without a deal on October 31  They would then seek to form a new government with the aims of delaying Brexit and holding either a second referendum or an election.  However, the group disagree on who should be caretaker prime minister.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has put himself forward but he has been rejected by Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, who has suggested an alternative figure such as Kenneth Clarke or Harriet Harman.  Former attorney general Dominic Grieve, one of 21 MPs stripped of the Tory whip, yesterday gave his backing to Dame Margaret and said he 'would be happy to serve in her administration'.  The Labour former foreign secretary has emerged as a leading choice among those plotting a government of national unity that would ask for a Brexit extension and then call a referendum or election  The Labour grandee last night said she believed it was 'extremely unlikely' and that nobody had 'discussed it seriously' with her.  But asked if she would refuse if asked to perform the role by MPs, she told The Evening Standard: 'Anybody who refused to serve in such circumstances would perhaps be unwise.'  However, Dame Margaret said she could not see a government of national unity 'working at all', adding: 'So I've not got excited about it in any way, shape or form but it's kind to think they have got a good opinion of me.  'It is very kind and very flattering - but to be perfectly honest it is not something I anticipate happening.'  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has put himself forward but he has been rejected by Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson  She stressed that she would prefer Mr Corbyn to get into Downing Street, saying: 'We already have a candidate for prime minister, thank you very much.'  Dame Margaret served as acting Labour leader for a couple of months in 1994 following the death of John Smith, but she lost out to Tony Blair in the subsequent leadership contest.  The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford yesterday suggested the party would be willing to back Mr Corbyn leading an interim government.  Ms Swinson has suggested an alternative figure such as Harriet Harman (pictured)  He told Sky News: 'It's not really about the individual, it is about the mechanism to create the election and Article 50.  'Under our constitution, it's right that the leader of the Opposition has the first opportunity to do that, and we would respect that as part of the process.  'We need to coalesce around an individual that can unite the Commons. We need to take our responsibilities to remove Boris from power and to make sure we have an election.",0
8,"Ellie Cooper, 20, has asked Boris Johnson to call a halt to 'inflammatory and aggressive' language amid fears her mother's safety could be at risk",8," The daughter of Labour MP Yvette Cooper has warned Boris Johnson that she is 'scared every single day' for her mother's safety.  In an emotional plea to the Premier, Ellie Cooper, 20, asked him to call a halt to 'inflammatory and aggressive' language.  Miss Cooper told how she has feared her mother could be killed ever since the murder of Jo Cox.  On Twitter, she wrote: 'Before then, my mum's job was something that kept her working later than bedtime when I was a kid, the source of embarrassing conversations at school, the reason we travelled to and fro between Yorkshire and London every week for the first two thirds of my life.  'It was never something that could get her killed. I am scared when I scroll through the replies to her tweets calling her a liar and a traitor.  'I am scared when our house gets fitted with panic buttons, industrial-locking doors and explosive bags to catch the mail.  'I am scared because on 16 June 2016, two children said goodbye to their mother before she left for her constituency to sit in surgeries and help people all day, and never saw her again.  'I am scared every single day that the same will happen to mine.'  Labour MP Yvette Cooper has had panic alarms installed in her home amid rising fears of an attack on MPs  Miss Cooper, whose father is former MP Ed Balls, added: 'Of course people have strong opinions, opinions that will inevitably come into conflict when trying to work out how best to deliver an outcome that split our country in two.  'But what we need now is a Prime Minister who can stand up and say ''Yes I want to deliver Brexit, but regardless of my position, this inflammatory and aggressive language needs to stop''.  Her mother, the former work and pensions secretary, replied: 'We get used to handling all the things that get thrown at us, but it's harder to see it through your children's eyes. I am very proud of my brave daughter.'",0
28,Boris Johnson agrees other MPs should moderate their language,28," Boris language In an interview with the BBC, ‘Prime’ Minister Boris Johnson has agreed that all other MPs should use respectful and moderate language in Commons debates.  His words came in the wake of an exchange yesterday when he invoked a murdered MP in the name of Brexit and other MPs were stridently critical of him.  “I agree with many that the language used against me beyond the pale,” he said, ruffling his own hair in a way that would be charming if he was five and not a fully-grown man.  “I think they need to moderate their language toward me, particularly those slags on the other benches and that Labour pooftah who gets all hot under the collar all the time.  “There was also some ghastly looking fat little common person who had the temerity to raise his voice toward me.  “I tell you, if I was back in my Bullingdon days, we’d have smashed up his car, had a go on his girlfriend and shat on his doorstep.”  He went on to summarise what he hoped to see.  “A bit more respectful language from the whole bally lot of them, I went to Eton, you know. They should show some respect.”  Asked if he would be making any effort to moderate his own language, he was unequivocal.  “Fuck off, I’m the Prime Minister and I’ll do what the fuck I like.  “Now, piss off you ghastly little communist or ill have your kids arrested.”",1
20,Theresa May’s latest Brexit deal ‘substantively different’ after being converted to Comic Sans,20," Brexit bill converted to Comic Sans Theresa May has found a way around Speaker John Bercow’s latest, bloody unreasonable demand that the next motion to vote on the Brexit deal should ensure the bill is substantively different from the last.  The new bill is entirely different, having been retyped word-for-word, but this time in Comic Sans font.  “It’s not what we’d hoped for, but then that’s Brexit,” shrugged MP, Simon Williams.  “The documentation also uses the word ‘whatever’ rather more than I’d hoped – in fact, it’s the title of many of the appendices.  “I appreciated the little cartoon of Theresa May throwing a grenade into the EU parliamentary chamber, but I’m not sure how that helps us understand anything. “It’s almost as if this whole thing has been written by someone in a panic, with no real concept of what is required. I did enjoy the dot-to-dot on page 48 though. Turns out it was Boris Johnson thumping a German.”  A spokesperson for the Tory party said, “We worked jolly hard on this, you know.  “You try making a picture of Jean-Claude Juncker entirely out of pasta. We had to send out for more glue.”",1
7,brexit countdown_bg Created with Sketch.,7," Remainer MPs are at loggerheads over whether they should try to strengthen an anti-No Deal law designed to force Boris Johnson to delay Brexit.  Under the so-called Benn Act passed at the start of the month Mr Johnson will have to go to Brussels on October 19 and beg for a three-month Article 50 extension if he has not agreed an exit deal with the EU by then.  But with the PM insisting Brexit will still happen on Halloween, with or without a deal, Remainers fear he is preparing to break the law.

But 21 ex-Tory MPs who were stripped of the party whip after backing the bid to block No Deal are against tampering with the existing law.  Instead they want to use the time between now and the October 19 deadline to hold the Prime Minister's feet to the fire in different ways.  Brexit Minister James Duddridge told the Commons this morning that the government would abide by what is on the statute book but insisted Mr Johnson remains committed to taking the UK out of the bloc on October 31.  'We will obey the law, but who knows what will happen between now and then in the negotiations,' Mr Duddridge said.  Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, said yesterday that she wants to toughen up an anti-No Deal law to force the PM to seek a Brexit delay as soon as next week  But 21 ex-Tory MPs like Rory Stewart (above, on GMB yesterday) are believed to be opposed to tampering with the legislation  Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson yesterday said that the UK could not wait until October 19, when the Benn Act - named after creator Labour MP Hilary Benn - says the PM must have asked the EU for a three-month extension if a No Deal split looks likely.  She said that there were fears that legal efforts to compel the PM to act might take longer than the period between the October 19 deadline and the Brexit departure date on Halloween.  Addressing the media outside Parliament yesterday, Ms Swinson argued that a 12-day buffer was not enough to safeguard against No Deal.  'We would argue that 12 days is not sufficient, particularly in line with a Prime Minister who has shown he is prepared to disobey the law,' she said, standing in front of Lib Dem MPs and peers.  'Even with the Supreme Court judgment, he has talked about disagreeing with it as if a Supreme Court judgment is something you can pick and choose whether or not it is right.  'That is why we have to bring forward the ways in which we can make sure the No Deal threat is removed.'  But Ms Swinson's plan appears doomed to fail after Labour responded coolly to the idea of changing the Benn Act.  'A lot of thought went into picking the date and it is not yet clear what problem the Libs are trying to fix,' a Labour source told The Telegraph.  However, there is growing dismay among some Remain-backing Labour MPs over Jeremy Corbyn's Brexit leadership.  Jeremy Corbyn, pictured in the House of Commons last night, is believed to be against the idea of changing the so-called Benn Act  One Labour MP said: 'It's humiliating. There's no leadership whatsoever. As usual he's present, but not involved.'  Meanwhile, the 21 Tory MPs who were stripped of the whip are also believed to be opposed to Ms Swinson's proposals.  They reportedly favour leaving the anti-No Deal law as it is and concentrating instead on ramping up the scrutiny of the PM's Brexit plans.  It is thought the 21 former Tories want to use parliamentary procedures and arcane devices to force the government to publish more details of its No Deal contingency planning and to keep the pressure on the PM with urgent questions and debates.  Such methods have proved productive for rebel MPs in the past as they have previously forced the government to hand over Brexit economic impact assessments and No Deal documents.",0
9,United Kingdom opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn will demand a general election as soon as a Brexit extension is secured from the European Union.,9," The Labour leader also pledged further action to ensure Prime Minister Boris Johnson asks for an extension, as demanded by the Benn Act passed in the days before Parliament was unlawfully suspended by Johnson. There has not been enough confidence on opposition benches that the prime minister would abide by that law.  ""It's not a matter of choice for him, it's an act of parliament that was passed. Last night, he seemed unable to give that undertaking (that he would obey the law),"" Corbyn told the PA news agency.  ""We will be taking parliamentary action on this again next week to ensure the prime minister does not crash us out of the EU on October 31 without a deal.""  That action would be to make demands on the prime minister to request the extension, but further discussions are to be held with the cross-party group on the specifics of the wording put before the legislature, he said.  Pressed on whether he would whip MPs to vote for an election the moment an extension is agreed, he said: ""Absolutely. Once we have agreed on the extension and carrying out the law of this country - at that point, and I made that very clear in my conference speech - we will support a general election.""  Anger sparked by Johnson  Johnson said on Thursday he needs to ""reach out"" to opposition MPs if he is to win their support in the Commons for a Brexit deal.  The prime minister said tempers need to ""come down"" after the angry scenes in the Commons on Wednesday.  However, he refused to apologise for describing the Benn Act, requiring him to seek a Brexit delay if he cannot get a new deal with the EU, as the ""surrender act"".  ""I need to reach out across the House of Commons,"" he told BBC South.  ""I think it is fair enough to call the surrender act what it is. I think it is absolutely reasonable. But we do need to bring people together, and get this thing done.  ""Tempers need to come down, and people need to come together because it's only by getting Brexit done that you'll lance the boil, as it were, of the current anxiety and we will be able to get on with the domestic agenda.""  'Toxic' parliament  Johnson had sparked fury on Wednesday as he doubled down on divisive rhetoric before storming out of the House of Commons chamber as MPs made impassioned appeals for him to dial down his language.  He had been begged by Paula Sheriff, a Labour MP, to cease using such terminology, referring to the murder of Jo Cox MP by a far-right Nazi sympathiser. She said the language being used in Parliament had consequences.  ""We should not resort to using offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language for legislation that we do not like and we stand here under the shield of our departed friend with many of us in this place subject to death threats and abuse every single day,"" said Sheriff.  190925134228605  ""And let me tell the prime minister that they often quote his words: surrender act, betrayal, traitor - and I for one am sick of it. We must moderate our language and it has to come from the prime minister first.""  She added: ""He should be absolutely ashamed of himself."" Her words prompted applause from the opposition benches.  Johnson replied: ""I have to say, Mr Speaker, I've never heard such humbug in all my life.""  The prime minister left the chamber shortly afterwards, before Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson described Johnson's words as ""sickening"", appearing to fight back tears as she revealed she had earlier reported to police a threat against her child.  Parliamentarians remained furious on Thursday, with more threats against them reported overnight. The office of Labour MP Jess Philips was attacked on Thursday afternoon, and a man arrested after reportedly attempting to kick the door down while yelling ""fascist"".  As the House of Commons reconvened, Speaker John Bercow told politicians to stop treating each other as enemies, saying the atmosphere in the legislature was the worst he had known since he was elected 22 years ago.  ""The culture was toxic,"" Bercow said in parliament.  And it was not just politicians who were angry. Johnson's own sister, Rachel, described her brother's words as a ""particularly tasteless"" way to refer to the memory of a murdered woman.  ""Words like 'collaborationist', 'traitor', 'betrayal'; my brother using words like 'surrender', 'capitulation', as if the people who are standing in the way of the blessed 'will of the people' - as defined by 17.4 million votes in 2016 - should be hung, drawn, quartered, tarred and feathered,"" she told Sky News. ""I think that it is highly reprehensible language to use.""  Strategy  Johnson's combative strategy appears straightforward: ridicule Parliament as a bunch of weaklings wedded to the EU and unwilling to follow ""the people's mandate"" to pull the country out of the world's largest trading bloc.  He may not be able to make good on his promise to make Brexit happen on October 31, but he has positioned himself for the inevitable election ahead so he can blame Parliament - and the EU's supposed intransigence - for keeping the UK within the EU.  While Johnson is setting the stage for a ""people-versus-parliament"" election, the reality is the nation remains deeply split over the wisdom of leaving the EU, and the debate has become ever more shrill and angry, particularly after the UK's Supreme Court unanimously declared earlier this week that the prime minister acted illegally in suspending Parliament for five weeks.  Johnson suffered yet another setback on Thursday after MPs rejected his call to briefly suspend their business for the Conservative Party's conference, highlighting the hostility he faces in a Parliament that he is unable to lead or govern.  He has now lost all seven parliamentary votes he has faced since taking power.",0
4,Prime Minister Boris Johnson suffered a record seventh defeat in the House of Commons on Thursday when members of Parliament rejected his request to allow them to leave for the Conservative Party conference next week.,4," The refusal to allow the Conservatives a conference recess breaks a long tradition between the political parties in the UK.  It came one day after Johnson was found to have broken the law by suspending Parliament for several weeks.  The Conservatives had argued that any refusal would damage businesses in Manchester, where the conference is due to take place.  Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday suffered a record seventh House of Commons defeat when members of Parliament voted to wreck the Conservative Party's annual conference by refusing a parliamentary recess.  The party is due to meet in Manchester on Sunday, with a speech by the prime minister on Wednesday.  However, MPs voted 306-289 on Thursday against allowing a Commons recess, meaning Parliament will still sit next week.  Former Conservative MPs who were kicked out of the party after rebelling on Brexit helped defeat the government, with the former Cabinet ministers David Gauke and Amber Rudd voting against the motion.  It throws the party's plans for the event into chaos and raises the prospect of Conservative MPs shuttling between Manchester and London from Sunday to Wednesday.  There was more confusion on Thursday when the government's chief whip emailed contradictory instructions to MPs.  In one email to Conservative MPs, and seen by Business Insider, Mark Spencer said while the conference would go ahead as planned, the government would ""need as many of you in London as possible.""  However, he later sent another email, also seen by Business Insider, urging Conservative MPs to attend the conference in Manchester.  Conferences are usually an opportunity for Cabinet ministers to make headline-grabbing policy announcements and can often hand the party in question a significant boost in polls.  But Jeremy Corbyn indicated on Wednesday that his Labour Party, which held its conference over the weekend, would not support attempts to shut down Parliament for the conference next week until Johnson backed down on his threats to break the law and force a no-deal Brexit on October 31.  Read more: Boris Johnson tells friends of slain MP Jo Cox to back Brexit if they want to stop getting death threats  ""I won't support anything that shuts down Parliament until it is absolutely clear that the government will abide by the law and apply for an extension,"" he told BBC Radio 4's ""Today"" program.  Johnson lost his working majority in the Commons earlier this month when he withdrew the Conservative whip from 21 rebels, meaning he would struggle to win any vote in the chamber.  Eight of those expelled MPs voted against the government on Thursday, helping to defeat the motion.  Usually, the government tables a motion at the start of September to allow a recess for each party to hold its conference over several weekends until October. But Johnson instead attempted to shut down Parliament from the start of September — a decision that on Wednesday was ruled unlawful — meaning MPs did not have a chance to vote on the usual recess schedule.",0

Now that it’s been absolutely months since the Avengers movies came to an end Marvel Studios has decided it’s time to start remaking them all with a clever twist.  “We want to make our superheroes relevant to the modern world,” said producer Simon Williams.  “When we started with the first Iron Man movie, Brexit wasn’t even a thing. People don’t go to the cinema to escape these thorny political issues – our audience wants us to tackle them head-on.  “Hence the latest gang of daft-looking wallies in positions of power – The Brexiters.”  Some casting details have been announced:  Boris Johnson will play The Hulk. Whenever he loses a parliamentary vote he becomes angry and turns into a hideous monster (to be played by Ann Widdecombe) shouting ‘Big Girl’s Blouse’ at random passersby.  Jacob Rees-Mogg will play Iron Lady Man. Wearing a Margaret Thatcher suit he flies around the UK creating unemployment and social inequality.  Nigel Farage will play Captain Britain. A weedy little twat created in a military laboratory, Captain Britain spends all his time reminiscing about the halcyon days of the Second World War – a better time when Brits were allowed to slag off the French and kill Germans. The Captain carries a Union Flag shield in order to protect himself from milkshakes.  Dominic Raab will play Thor.

1,brexit countdown_bg Created with Sketch.,1," Opposition leaders gathered in Parliament today to plot how to tie Boris Johnson's hands over Brexit.  Jeremy Corbyn joined Remainers Jo Swinson and Ian Blackford as well as the leaders of minor parties to discuss how they can ensure the Prime Minister obeys the law and seeks another Brexit delay.  Under the so-called Benn Act passed at the start of the month Mr Johnson will have to go to Brussels on October 19 and beg for a three-month Article 50 extension if he has not agreed an exit deal with the EU by then.  But with the PM insisting Brexit will still happen on Halloween, with or without a deal, Remainers fear he is preparing to break the law.  Some are worried that the current legislation to force his hand might may not be strong enough and want to make it 'bulletproof'.  A Lib Dem source said this afternoon's meeting was 'positive', while Labour said another meeting would take place on Monday, during the Conservative Party Conference.  Mr Corbyn pledged further parliamentary action to ensure Prime Minister Boris Johnson asks for an extension, as demanded by the Benn Act.  In an interview, the Labour leader said: 'It's not a matter of choice for him, it's an Act of Parliament that was passed. Last night he seemed unable to give that undertaking.

But 21 ex-Tory MPs who were stripped of the party whip after backing the bid to block No Deal are said to be against tampering with the existing law.  Instead they want to use the time between now and the October 19 deadline to hold the Prime Minister's feet to the fire in different ways.

17,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks in the House of Commons, London, after judges at the Supreme Court ruled that his advice to the Queen to suspend Parliament for five weeks was unlawful. House of Commons - PA Images | PA Images | Getty Images",17," Frustrations over Brexit blew up into anger and tears in Parliament on Wednesday night as lawmakers first vented fury over the government's refusal to apologize for unlawful actions and then railed at Prime Minister Boris Johnson's language in relation to a murdered MP. The House of Commons – Britain's lower house of Parliament – resumed activities Wednesday after the U.K. Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the Conservative government had acted unlawfully to suspend its sitting. The country's Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, who had advised ministers that prorogation would be legal, stood up to reiterate the Conservative Party line that while they would respect the ruling, they did not agree with it.  Opposition MPs (members of parliament) were quickly on the attack — accusing Johnson and his colleagues of eroding democracy and failing to respect the judiciary's role within U.K. society. Addressing Parliament, Cox quickly dismissed any notion the government would be repentant, instead booming to the House that that opposition MP's were ""a disgrace"" for refusing to grant Johnson the snap election he craves. ""This parliament is a dead parliament. It should no longer sit, it has no moral right to sit on these green benches,"" added Cox. That prompted an opposition lawmaker, Labour's Barry Sheerman, to visibly shake and turn crimson as he raged that the U.K.'s attorney general — the crown and government's top lawyer — had ""no shame at all."" ""To come here with his barrister's bluster to obfuscate the truth - a man like him, a party like this and a leader like this to talk about morals and morality. It's a disgrace."" The poisonous atmosphere continued through the day as lawmakers continuously called on U.K. leader Boris Johnson to resign.  PM raises the temperature  Johnson arrived at the angry scene in the early evening to make a statement and take questions. Any possibility that he would reduce the tension quickly evaporated as he struck an indignant tone, repeatedly accused opposition benches of betrayal and ""surrender"" to Europe. The Prime Minister goaded opponents to call an election, waving his arms and shouting: ""come on, come on."" Parliament, Johnson said was ""refusing to deliver on the priorities of the people"" while Labour were ""determined to throw out the referendum result, whatever the cost."" ""We will not betray the people who sent us here,"" Johnson roared to huge cheers from his own benches and visible anger opposite.  In the bear pit atmosphere, opposition lawmaker Alison McGovern raised the case of Jo Cox — a Labour MP who was murdered in the days leading up to the 2016 Brexit referendum by a man who attacked her while yelling ""Britain first."" Johnson caused gasps and shouting by responding to McGovern that the best way to honor Cox's life was to deliver the Brexit vote. Then lawmaker Paula Sherriff then said she had received death threats from people who echoed the use of Johnson's language. The Prime Minister responded: ""I have never heard so much humbug in my life.""

35,Brexiters fear European elections could create a rift between idiots and racists,35," old people fighting Many prominent leave supporters are deeply concerned that the European elections could threaten the long-standing alliance between racists and easily-duped cretins, that has always been the foundation of British Euroscepticism.  The division of the most ardent Europhobes into 2 distinct parties has many worried that the potent combination that propelled the brexit vote, of closet white supremacists and dim nostalgics who aren’t keen on spicy food, is in peril. As explained Daily Mail columnists and best-selling author of ‘Everything Was Better Before’, Simon Williams.  “The people who just want to hurt ethnic minorities will be firmly support UKIP whereas Nigel Farage will sweep up the votes of fearful codgers who hope they can recreate their childhood in the few years before they shuffle off this mortal coil.  “The big fear is that these two parties will not be as potent as when they are combined. After all, UKIP is already suffering from the lack of dumb but well-meaning biddies to shove in front of the headcases who dream of ethnic cleansing. Like Tommy Robinson.  “As for the new Brexit Party, genteel retirees who are still resentful of having to learn the metric system may vote in large numbers, but they aren’t exactly energetic campaigners. Mainly because of their hips.  “And that’s without mentioning the fact that many dimwits and bigots are finding they are actually well represented by some Tory politicians, like Mark Francois.”  However, Mr Williams said there was still hope that Brexit supporters could send a record number of MEPs to sponge off the system they claim to hate.  He concluded, “Well thankfully the Remain parties are refusing to unite and make common cause. And Labour is just pretending Brexit doesn’t exist.  “We can always rely on old Jeremy.”",1

38,Moment of Brexit tenderness as adorable British MPs think Article 50 extension is up to them,38," Parliament so cute about article 50 In an endearing scene that melted hearts all over Europe, amusingly bossy British politicians stomped their feet and insisted that they would tell the EU to give an extension to Article 50 despite having less say on the matter than a part-time assistant to a Flemish regional minister.  MP Mark Francois, 53 and ½, was one of many in Westminster who spoke out about the deal while wearing a lovely blazer that made him look like a future heart breaker as long as he stops scoffing chocolate.  Although he voted against it, Mark was adamant Brussels would do as it was told.  “I got my own army uniform and every time we play war I’m the one who’s the chief. I’ll tell those boys in Brocksalls that they better give an extension or else. And Jacob said I could do it because Jacob is my friend and he also said I can come to his house and ride one of his ponies if I want. Do you collect pogs? I’ve got hundreds!”  Although the EU did not take an official stance, the Commissioner for Trade, Sigmiund Wilhelms said that the vote left many in EU capitals sighing and cooing.  He went on, “It’s so sweet they think it’s up to them. The truth is the Slovenian intern who works in Barnier’s office will have more impact on the decision to grant or refuse an extension.

It’s really annoying.”  Boris is currently maintaining his protest by occasionally opening his bedroom window and shouting ‘it’s not fair, let me do what whatever I want’ at anyone who’ll listen.  It is understood that if he still can’t get what he wants by tomorrow, he plans to poo his own pants because he’s ‘in charge and can do what he likes.’",1
22,Nigel Farage unveils the Night King as Brexit Party candidate for European elections,22," night king joins Brexit Party Nigel Farage has announced that the supreme leader and first of the White Walkers is to stand as a candidate for his Brexit Party in the forthcoming European elections.  At a rally in Clacton-on-Sea, the king of the undead told supporters he was standing on a programme of delivering the Brexit the people of Britain had voted for and to eradicate all humanity from the more fashionable parts of London.  “It’s time to put the traitors and enemies of the people to the sword,” the Night King told jubilant party members who had gathered to hear precisely this sort of thing.  “I’m talking about the quisling remainers, the saboteur MPs and I’m talking about Jon Snow – the Channel 4 News guy not the Bastard of Winterfell.  “Nothing can stop us on our march to Brussels, except a determined foe armed with vast quantities of dragonglass – and maybe UKIP.”  The Night King told reporters that he had considered joining UKIP, but that he decided against it when he discovered how unpleasant their current members are.  “When Nigel called I knew this was the party for me,” said the leader of the army of the dead.  “I’ve spent 10,000 years in the Land of Always Winter among the forces of the living dead, which, when you think about it, is ideal preparation for joining an organisation with the demographics of the Brexit Party.”  “And I might have been around since the age of the first men but I’m still one of the youngest in the room by the looks of things.”  At the conclusion of the rally, Mr Farage and the Night King were joined on stage by a hideous and terrifying dragon that everyone thought had perished many years ago, but she flatly refused to talk about her time on Strictly.",1
33,Brexiters excitedly repeating ‘we survived The Blitz’ reminded that many people didn’t,33," Blitz spirit Brexiters who repeatedly affirm that Britain will survive a no-deal Brexit because they survived The Blitz have been reminded that there were one or two casualties during that period in time.  With the possibility of a no-deal Brexit looming and increasing fears over food and medicine supplies after March 29th, many Leave voters have taken to telling anyone who will listen that fears are unfounded because Britain survived the Blitz, and therefore the little matter of walking away from one of the largest trading unions in the world is no big deal.  Brexiter Simon Williams, who was born in 1958 and technically therefore didn’t ‘survive’ either of the World Wars took to social to media, saying ,”We survived The Blitz, won two World Wars and beat that German lot once in a game of football.  “I was only eight at the time, and I was drunk when I was watching it so barely remember the game itself, but I’m told it was a complete drubbing of those continental bastards.  “A no-deal Brexit, like The Blitz, might cause a bit of disruption for the first week or so, but no-one will die, mark my words.  “Wait, what’s that? Over forty thousand civilians died in the Blitz? But I thought we won the war? Those statistics are fake news, mate.”  Historian and whingeing remoaner Christopher James told us, “Unfortunately, there is a trend of viewing historical conflicts through rose-tinted glasses, but sometimes the rose tint comes from blood splatters.  “I’m pretty sure those soldiers didn’t fight and give their lives for peace in Europe so their nationalistic offspring could try and tear it all apart again.”",1
2,Boris Johnson's divisive aide Dominic Cummings was confronted by a furious Labour shadow minister in Parliament today who accused him of masterminding the Prime Ministers role in a 'toxic' Commons confrontation.,2," Shadow transport minister Karl Turner made a beeline for the No 10 chief of staff when he saw him this afternoon, telling him 'people are blaming you' for last night's bruising encounter.  Brexiteer Mr Cummings has been heralded as encouraging a 'people versus Parliament' strategy to push through Brexit.  Labour wants the PM to apologise after he said the 'best way to honour the memory' of murdered MP Jo Cox is for Parliament to 'get Brexit done'.  He also claimed the 'best way' for MPs to stay 'properly safe' is for them to help him deliver the UK's departure from the European Union on October 31.  Mr Turner, the MP for Leave-voting Kingston-upon-Hull in Yorkshire, confronted the Tory aide in Portcullis House, part of the parliamentary estate.  The MP said 'I’ve had death threats overnight, should be dead', to which Mr Cummings, leaning on a post, coolly replied; 'Get Brexit done.'  Shadow transport minister Karl Turner made a beeline for the No 10 chief of staff when he saw him this afternoon  Mr Cummings responded by telling the shadow minister: 'I don’t know who you are'  This seemed to antagonise the Labour MP further, as he replied: 'It’s a disgrace.  'Get Brexit done? I’ve had three opportunities to get Brexit done. If I could have voted for it, I would have voted for it. Don’t tell me to get Brexit done.  'The Prime Minister should be there (Brussels) negotiating a deal to bring back for me to support.'  Labour wants the PM to apologise after he said the 'best way to honour the memory' of murdered MP Jo Cox is for Parliament to 'get Brexit done'  Mr Turner scolded the PM in the Commons on Wednesday for 'laughing and joking' and using 'aggressive language' towards MPs while they were questioning him about the decision to prorogue Parliament  118 Church of England archbishops and bishops condemns MPs 'unacceptable' language Every archbishop and bishop in the Church of England has condemned the language used by MPs as ‘unacceptable’. In a joint statement, the 118 members of the College of Bishops said: ‘In the last few days the use of language, both in debates and outside parliament, has been unacceptable. ‘We should speak to others with respect… We should not denigrate, patronise or ignore the honest views of fellow citizens but seek to respect their opinions, their participation in society, and their votes’. The bishops acknowledged they were ‘conscious of the great challenges MPs face’ but urged for ‘respect on all sides amid growing acrimony.’ The Archbishop of Canterbuty, the Most Rev Justin Welby, told The Times: ‘The foundations of our unity and way of life are being challenged. ‘There needs to be a cooling of tempers on all sides in order to enable people to try to come to an agreement to see what solution can unite the country and do what has to be done.’ This is not the first time the church has intervened on Brexit. In August this year, a group of 25 bishops wrote an open letter warning of the dangers of leaving the European Union without a deal. In it signatories, including the Bishop of London and the Bishop of Manchester, said: ‘Our main social and political priority must be to leave well, paying particular attention to the impact of political decisions on those most vulnerable.’  Mr Cummings responded by telling the shadow minister: 'I don’t know who you are.'  The Hull East MP had scolded the PM in the Commons on Wednesday for 'laughing and joking' and using 'aggressive language' towards MPs while they were questioning him about the decision to prorogue Parliament for five weeks, a move Supreme Court judges this week ruled unanimously to be unlawful.  He said threats then followed 'overnight' that 'caused me great stress'.  One person on the Facebook group Yellow Vest Hull said Mr Turner 'wants putting in a ditch', echoing the PM's phrase that he would rather be 'dead in a ditch' than ask the European Union for an Article 50 extension.  Another said they were tempted to 'pay a visit' to the MP, who represents a seat that voted 72 per cent to leave the EU.  Mr Turner later told PA Media he was 'truly worried' about his family's safety - he has a three year old daughter - having previously had a person arrive at his house in Hull to confront him.  Brexiteer Mr Cummings (pictured in Downing Street today) has been heralded as encouraging a 'people versus Parliament' strategy to push through Brexit  Mr Cummings, pictured at a book launch today, previously goaded Jeremy Corbyn when he saw him in Parliament earlier this month  As they passed eachother in Westminster, Mr Cummings told the Labour leader: 'Come on Jeremy, let's do this election, don't be scared'  'The reason I was provoked into making an impassioned plea for him to stop allowing the tone of the debate to be as it is, is because I am truly worried about my family,' he said.  'I've had previous experiences of attacks on the house and the family and you can't decide when you see these threats whether it is a serious death threat or whether it is just someone firing off at the keyboard when they've had too much to drink. I don't know and it worries me.'  It is not the first time Mr Cummings, who was the chief strategist for the Vote Leave campaign, has interacted with an MP.  Earlier this month, he is said to have goaded Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, shouting: 'Come on Jeremy, let's do this election, don't be scared' as they passed each other in Westminster.",0

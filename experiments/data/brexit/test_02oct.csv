Addressing his party conference in Manchester, the PM said his plan would be a ""compromise by the UK"", but he hoped the EU would ""understand that and compromise in their turn"".  The European Commission said they will ""examine [the proposals] objectively"".  The Irish PM said he had not seen the plans but was ""not encouraged"".  Leo Varadker told the Irish Parliament: ""What we are hearing is not encouraging and would not be the basis for agreement.""  The UK is set to leave the EU on 31 October.  The government has insisted it will not negotiate a further delay beyond the Halloween deadline, saying this would be unnecessary and costly for the UK.  However, under the terms of a law passed by Parliament last month, the PM faces having to request another extension unless MPs back the terms of withdrawal by 19 October - two days after a summit of European leaders.  The European Commission's President Jean-Claude Juncker and Mr Johnson will speak on the phone later, and the two sides' negotiating teams will also meet.  In his speech, Mr Johnson said no-deal was not an outcome the government was seeking, but ""it is an outcome for which we are ready"".  On the eve of his speech, Mr Johnson told a conference fringe meeting, hosted by the DUP, that he hoped to reach a deal with the EU over the course of ""the next few days"".  What has the PM proposed?  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption PM: Boris Johnson: ""It (no deal) is not an outcome we want... but is an outcome for which we are ready""  The issue of the Irish border - and how to keep it free from border checks when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU - has been a key sticking point in Brexit negotiations.  Mr Johnson has said the solution reached by the EU and Theresa May, the backstop, is ""anti-democratic"" and ""inconsistent with the sovereignty of the UK"", claiming it offered no means for the UK to unilaterally exit and no say for the people of Northern Ireland over the rules that would apply there.  The PM used his speech to confirm parts of his offer to the EU.  He said that ""under no circumstances"" would there be checks at or near the border in Northern Ireland and the proposals would respect the peace process and the Good Friday agreement.  It included promising ""a process of renewable democratic consent"" for the Stormont Assembly on its relationship with the EU going forward.  He also referred to the use of technological solutions to ensure there was no hard border on the island of Ireland.  He said he did not want a deal to be out of reach ""because of what is essentially a technical discussion of the exact nature of future customs checks when that technology is improving the whole time"".  Mr Johnson also said he would ""protect the existing regulatory arrangements for farmers and other businesses on both sides of the border"".  He added: ""At the same time we will allow the UK - whole and entire - to withdraw from the EU, with control of our own trade policy from the start.""  The PM said this would ""protect the union"".  Echoing the main slogan of the conference, Mr Johnson said: ""Let's get Brexit done on 31 October…to answer the cry of those 17.4 million who voted for Brexit [and] for those millions who may have voted Remain, but are first and foremost democrats and accept the result of the referendum.""  He said the Tories were ""not an anti-European party"" and the UK is ""not an anti-European country"".  The PM added: ""We love Europe. We are European.  ""But after 45 years of really dramatic constitutional change, we must have a new relationship with the EU.""  This speech was hugely important for Boris Johnson's Brexit deal.  Be in no doubt that amongst those listening most closely, most intently, will be leaders in other European capitals, trying to gauge whether Mr Johnson is serious about a Brexit deal or whether he is paving the way for no-deal and looking to blame the EU.  This was actually a rather surprising speech because there was none of the aggressive, combative language that we had been expecting - none of the in your face, take it or leave it final offer that we were told would form the guts of his argument.  Instead, it seemed Mr Johnson went out of his way to adopt a rather more emollient approach, saying how much he loved Europe, how the Tory Party wasn't an anti-European party and how Britain wasn't an anti-European country.  What that meant was that Mr Johnson didn't endeavour to bring the house down in the conference hall. He didn't go for the easy Brussels bashing, and for the wider viewers in this country, there were no brand new policy announcements.  You sense Mr Johnson has calculated for the next few hours and days that the really crucial audience in terms of his premiership, and for his future, is not here in Manchester - it's in capitals around the EU.  What does the EU think?  Image copyright Reuters  Before Mr Johnson's speech, a European Commission spokeswoman said they would examine the proposals objectively, adding: ""We will listen carefully to the UK.""  She said the EU wanted to agree a deal with the UK, saying ""an orderly withdrawal is far more preferable than a 'no-deal' scenario"".  But the spokeswoman also reminded the UK of its ""well-known criteria"", saying: ""In order for there to be a deal, we must have a legally operational solution that meets all the objectives of the backstop.  ""[That means] preventing a hard border, preserving North-South cooperation and the all-island economy, and protecting the EU's Single Market and Ireland's place in it.""  Leo Varadker said he would work until the last moment to secure an agreement, but he added: ""We will not do so at any cost, and we are ready for no-deal if that's what the British decide to do.""  The BBC's Europe editor, Katya Adler said the bloc wanted to do a deal and needed to be seen to try.  But she added it was ""fundamentally misunderstanding the EU"" if the prime minister believed the other 26 EU leaders will turn round to Ireland and say they have to accept the proposals just they want to have a deal.  What has been the reaction to his speech?  Image copyright PA Media  There were huge rounds of applause for Mr Johnson from within the conference hall, showing support from his party.  After the speech, one member said the PM was ""exactly what we need"", while another said she had been ""inspired"", adding: ""We are so fed up with nothing happening, but we feel like something will happen now because we think he will deliver.""  Leaving the hall, Tory MP Mims Davies described her leader as ""bombastic Boris"", saying: ""That [speech] was a message to the country, a message to our party and a message to the EU - we are ready to get on with this.""  But the PM's plan has been branded as ""extreme"" and ""doomed to failure"" by the SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, who said his strategy was leading towards a no-deal.  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the prime minister's speech was ""absolute bluster"" and he described it as a ""cynical manipulation to get a no-deal"".  Mr McDonnell also that any Brexit deal or no-deal should be put to the people to make the final decision.  The director general of the CBI, Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, praised the PM's ""optimistic vision for the UK"".  But she said his plan ""relies on a good Brexit deal"".  ""The UK is at a crossroads,"" she said. ""[And] the no-deal turning ends in a very different place: a swamp that will slow the UK's every step for years to come.""  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Boris Johnson: ""If Parliament were a reality TV show... the whole lot of us would've been voted out of the jungle""  What else did Mr Johnson say in his speech?  Image copyright PA Media  The PM also used the opportunity to criticise Parliament, saying it ""refuses to deliver Brexit, refuses to do anything constructive and refuses to have an election"".  He said: ""I am afraid that after three and a half years people are beginning to feel that they are being taken for fools.""  Mr Johnson said the Tories were ""the party of the NHS"" because of their belief in capitalism, adding: ""We understand the vital symmetry at the heart of the modern British economy between a dynamic enterprise culture and great public services precisely because we are the party of capitalism.""  He praised London as its former mayor, but pledged to ""unlock talent in every corner of the UK"", and ensure safety with his existing policies of 20,000 additional police officers and tackling county lines gangs.  And he repeated more policy announcements from the conference on infrastructure, education, law and order.  Mr Johnson concluded: ""Let's get on with sensible moderate one nation but tax-cutting Tory government and, figuratively if not literally, let us send Jeremy Corbyn into orbit where he belongs.  ""Let's get Brexit done [and] let's bring our country together.""  Mr Johnson's conference speech clashed with Prime Minister's Questions.  Normally the Commons goes into recess for the Tory conference, but MPs voted against this amid the bitter fallout from the government's unlawful prorogation of Parliament.  Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab deputised for the prime minister, facing the shadow home secretary Diane Abbott over the despatch box.  He told MPs the government will present its written Brexit proposals to them later.  Do you have any questions about Brexit?  Use this form to ask your question:",0
33,UK negotiator leaves threat of shitting himself on the table in order to secure Brexit deal,33," Brexit negotiations With Boris Johnson replacing Theresa May as UK PM, the dynamic of the Brexit negotiations have changed dramatically.  Since coming into the role of Brexit negotiator, David Frost (not that one) has refused to rule out shitting himself in order to force the EU into a favourable deal.  “It’s important that the EU understand I’m serious here,” said Mr Frost.  “I will not hesitate to shit in my own pants if they don’t make changes to the backstop.  “When you’re in a top-level negotiation like this, you never take anything off the table. I know that because I read it in my Negotiation for Dummies book.”  However, despite Mr Frost’s resolute attitude, the threat has only served to confuse the EU.  “I understand that Mr Frost will shit in his pants, yes,” explained EU negotiator Michel Barnier, who must have countless better things he could be doing.  “But, I don’t really understand why he thinks this is such a threat to the EU. They are, after all, his pants.  “Whilst the negotiation room will smell a bit, this is not a big problem for us, we open the window and the smell goes away, but for Mr Frost? His pants and trousers are all beshitted. He can try cleaning them, I suppose, but I would imagine they will be ruined beyond repair.”  Undeterred by the EU’s refusal to be cowed by his threat to shit himself, Mr Frost is prepared ramp up his threats.  “Alright, they’re not bothered if I shit myself? Fine,” he said.  “What about if I punch myself in my own face as well? That’ll show them.”",1
25,Ramsgate declared ‘Brexit Capital’ due to being home to Seaborne Freight and UK’s largest Wetherspoon,25," Ramsgate Brexit capital The coastal town of Ramsgate, Kent, has been named ‘Brexit Capital of Britain’ after perfectly encapsulating everything about Britain’s split from the EU.  The town, where the dozens and dozens of shiny new Seaborne Freight cargo and passenger ferries are currently moored in all their glory, is also home to the largest branch of regular Brexiteer watering hole, Wetherspoon.  Brexit Secretary for the current week, Stephen Barclay, made the announcement today, saying, “The wonderful town of Ramsgate beautifully represents all that is marvellous about Brexit.  “Although I have never been there, obviously, I expect it looks like it is still living in those halcyon days of post-war Britain, with quaint little ice cream shops and foreigners being verbally abused outside a high street branch of Wilkinsons.  “If the operators of Seaborne Freight chose Ramsgate in which to start-up a multi-million pound business and get it all up and running in the space of two months, then that says a lot about the spirit of the town itself.”  He went on, “Then after a hard day’s work operating an efficient ferry service from a port that easily rivals Dover, where better to refresh oneself than in The Pavilion, Britain’s largest Wetherspoons pub.  “There is not a place on this island you can stand that will make you more proud to be British.”  Ramsgate resident Simon Williams responded, “No sign of a ferry here, mate. But he’s right about ‘Spoons. It’s massive, and there’s nowhere better to have a drunken brawl in the whole of Kent.”",1
2,"Boris Johnson just outlined his final, take it or leave it pitch for a Brexit deal to the European Union Wednesday, warning that if the bloc didn’t work with him, Britain was fully prepared to leave with no deal.",2," But the prime minister's plan, published on Twitter, is so far off the mark that it looks like a deliberate attempt to sabotage any deal.  Even before the British government submitted its proposal to EU headquarters in Brussels, Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said that a leaked version of the plans did not “look like the basis for an agreement,” and suggested it might not even be a serious attempt to reach an agreement.  Before tweeting out the five-point proposal, Johnson outlined his plan in a speech to members of his Conservative Party in Manchester, saying no deal wasn’t the outcome his government wanted, but “it is an outcome for which we are ready.” Britain is scheduled to leave the EU on Oct. 31, and Johnson has said the country will leave, deal or no deal.  In an effort to sidestep opposition from MPs, he took the extraordinary step last month of suspending Parliament for a five-week period ahead of the Brexit deadline. But Britain’s Supreme Court ruled that the suspension was politically motivated and therefore illegal, dealing a major blow to his strategy.  An alternative to the ‘backstop’  The most contentious sticking point in negotiations with the EU has been the status of the Irish border, dividing Northern Ireland, part of the UK, with the Republic of Ireland, an EU state.  Negotiations have stalled on questions surrounding customs and regulatory arrangements along the border — the only land border that the UK will share with the EU after Brexit.  Currently, goods and services flow freely between the two jurisdictions, and the UK and Europe agree there can’t be a return to any border infrastructure separating them. The guarantee of an open border was crucial to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which brought an end to the 30 years of sectarian conflict known as the Troubles.  Security officials believe that any new physical infrastructure in Northern Ireland would become targets for sectarian violence and fuel regional tensions. There are also concerns from business that customs checks would disrupt cross-border trade, worth about £5 billion ($6.2 billion).  A previous draft Brexit deal reached by Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, with the EU had proposed a so-called backstop as a solution, in which Britain would stay in the customs union until a new trade deal with the EU had been agreed. But this was rejected by members of May’s Conservative government, including Johnson, who said it was “inconsistent with the sovereignty of the UK"" and feared it could lead to Britain becoming trapped in the customs union indefinitely.  Johnson, who is determined to find an alternative to the backstop, said he would offer to keep Northern Ireland in the European single market for goods but leave the EU customs union, along with the rest of the UK, after a transition period.  That would require some customs checks to be introduced — a measure he argued could be alleviated through introducing new systems including electronic paperwork, and a “very small number” of physical checks.  Johnson said that customs checks were “just a reality,” but insisted that these would not be at the border. “We will under no circumstances have checks at or near the border in Northern Ireland. We will respect the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement,” he said.  Not even close, says Ireland  While Johnson framed his proposals as a compromise, and said he hoped his negotiating partners in Europe would “understand that and compromise in their turn,” initial indications weren’t promising. The imposition of customs checks between Ireland and Northern Ireland are a longstanding red line for the EU.  The European Commission said Wednesday it would examine the proposals objectively, but Coveney, Ireland’s foreign minister and deputy prime minister, said the proposal didn’t look like a promising basis for negotiation.  He said his government’s position had consistently held there be “no physical border infrastructure on the island of Ireland, and no related checks or controls.”  “The idea that you would be putting a customs border effectively between Northern Ireland and the Republic is not something that is consistent with that, or even close.”  He suggested the proposals were so far off the mark that they may not be a genuine attempt to reach a deal.  “If there is a proposal that involves customs checks on the island of Ireland, that in itself is bad faith given the commitments the British government has given both to Ireland and the EU over the last three years,"" he said.  British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn was also scathing of the proposal, saying the proposed alternative to the backstop was ""worse than Theresa May's deal.”  He claimed that Johnson knew “full well that what he's put forward is unlikely to be agreed,” saying the prime minister appeared intent on a no-deal Brexit.  Johnson is due to speak with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to discuss the proposals later Wednesday, with the clock ticking before the UK is scheduled to leave the EU at the end of the month. Under the terms of a law passed by Parliament last month, Johnson is obliged to ask the EU for another extension unless MPs back the terms of withdrawal by Oct. 19. But he's insisted he will not do so.  Cover: Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivers his Leader's speech at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester, England, Wednesday, Oct. 2, 2019.

17,"In his office in Derry, Gavin Killeen has the television on.",17," Like most business owners on the Border, he has spent the 3½ years since the Brexit referendum glued to the latest news and trying to divine what each fresh headline might mean for his company.  Killeen is the managing director of Nuprint Technologies which employs more than 40 people manufacturing and supplying labels and flexible packaging for the food and drink industry across Ireland. Their customers’ products are displayed on the wall behind him; they include Bushmills whiskey, Donegal Creameries and Lacpatrick Dairies.  As British prime minister Boris Johnson prepares to address the Conservative party conference, Killeen has a pen and paper ready, to take notes. The Border is only a mile away. All Killeen’s raw materials are imported from the EU and 35 per cent of his business is with the Republic of Ireland.  This matters – to his business, to his way of life – but he is not hopeful. “This is probably the realisation of the worst fears we’ve had over all these years about Brexit.”  Johnson begins to speak. “Let’s get Brexit done,” he says. Killeen repeats it, shaking his head. “Let’s get Brexit done? That’s the answer for everything.”  The British prime minister outlines his plans. “We will,” he says, “under no circumstances have checks at or near the Border in Northern Ireland”.  “We will respect the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement and by a process of renewable democratic consent by the Executive and Assembly of Northern Ireland, we will go further and protect the existing regulatory arrangements for farmers and businesses on both sides of the Border.”  This proposal, says Johnson, would allow the UK “whole and entire to withdraw from the EU”.  “It’s complete nonsense,” is Killeen’s initial reaction. “How can you have all of that on one side, and then have the UK withdraw as a whole on the other?”  Johnson continues. The proposals are a “compromise”, he says, but “if we fail to get an agreement because of what is essentially a technical discussion on the exact nature of future customs checks when that technology is improving the whole time, then let us be in no doubt . . . about the alternative – the alternative is no-deal”.  This is not an outcome the UK wants, he says, but “it is an outcome for which we are ready”.  “I think that [a no-deal Brexit] is the outcome he wants,” is Killeen’s response. “It’s the outcome he’s prepared for. He [Johnson] says all the things he doesn’t want to happen, but he doesn’t say how to avoid them. There are no solutions.  “Listen to the words, ‘there will not be checks on or near the Border’. Listen to the things he’s not saying – that means there will be checks, just removed from the Border. Or will there be random customs checks? What would be the consequences of that?”  The consequences of any such customs checks would be significant for the firm. There would be an increase in paperwork, potential delays, tariff charges to pay, and the collection of VAT at point of entry would create cash-flow problems for small businesses.  “Capital will find the part of least resistance,” explains Killeen. “Businesses will stop trading across the Border. We’ll turn our back on the Border, and we’ll try and grow our business by trading internally within the UK.”  Customs checks  He is concerned by the lack of clarity: “He’s said nothing concrete at all. It’s all bluster and bravado, with no substance. We’re not any clearer. All we know is ‘let’s get Brexit done’ is the strapline.”  According to plans outlined by Boris Johnson in a letter to European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, later on Wednesday, the North would become part of an all-island regulatory zone but would leave the customs union, which would necessitate customs checks.  The Northern Ireland Assembly would be given the power to approve the arrangements and to vote on them every four years. The plans have been supported by the DUP, but rejected by the North’s other four main parties.  Killeen’s belief is that the most likely outcome is a no-deal Brexit.  “You hope it won’t put you out of business, and you may have a few pretty fallow years, but you have to see what way it works. We have to try other things,” he says.  “There will be people that will try and capitalise on this and use it to their advantage to the detriment of society. And I think we do need our politicians and our business leaders to speak up and try and be a calming influence on what lies ahead, because it does look like it will be a very difficult, difficult period.”",0
38,Britain to repeat its Brexit offer loudly and slowly until the foreigners get it,38," Boris Brexit offer In dramatic scenes today, the Conservative Party has voted for Boris Johnson to return to Brussels and repeat the same offer loudly and slowly until the foreigners get it.  The EU has repeatedly rejected the proposals because they’re a bit slow and obviously didn’t understand them the first time, but senior figures within the party are confident that somebody new saying loudly saying ‘SPEAKEE ENGLISHEE’ will break the deadlock.  “The first time we explained the deal we’re after, Michel Barnier just cupped one ear and said ‘Que?’, so we think there’s room for movement there,” said MP Simon Williams.  ”All Boris has to do to make Parliament happy is get the deal we have been specifically told isn’t on the table – and he can do that by raising his voice and enunciating ev-er-y syl-lab-ble. Like that,” he said.  “If I were Prime Minister I would have done it by now. It would have been dead easy, but I know how to talk to foreigners as I holiday in the Peloponnese every year.”",1
37,Most Brexiters planning to blame any consequence of No Deal Brexit on Sadiq Khan,37," Sadiq Khan blamed for Brexit As Boris Johnson refuses to negotiate with the EU and the prospect of No Deal becomes very real, leave supporters are relishing the prospect of blaming any economic downturn on the Mayor of London.  Speaking from the Croydon Wetherspoons where he whittles away the day, retired fishmonger and full-time arsehole Simon Williams, explained that he was already practising holding Sadiq Khan responsible for any ill effects of the policy he supports.  “I’ll be honest, I’ve nearly given up claiming No Deal will be a piece of piss. I thought it would only fuck over my smug children for being smarter than me, but I’ve just realised that my yearly holiday in Benidorm could be more expensive. That and the wife’s insulin supply could be a problem.  “But I believe in British pluck. We will just have to take the hardships and use them to attack that Muslim snowflake who is making kids stab each other through sharia magic or something. When the shelves run bare, I will bang on incessantly that Sadiq Khan needs to stop being so PC and get it sorted.”  Mr Williams also explained that the act of blaming every ill of the world on a high profile British Muslim was a safety blanket in uncertain times.  “Everything is confusing nowadays. I used to be a Farage man but now I have another philandering money-grubbing racist to slavishly follow in the shape of Boris Johnson. No one has any idea of what tomorrow will bring.  “But whatever happens, I have the safety of knowing I can spout off about how every last one of society’s problems is the fault of a brown man that scares me.”",1
4,"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged the European Union to compromise as he prepares to put forward what he called ""constructive and reasonable proposals"" to Brussels to resolve the Brexit deadlock.",4," Addressing the Conservative Party conference on Wednesday, Johnson warned that the country was ready to leave without a deal on October 31 if no agreement was reached - even though he is compelled by law to seek a deadline extension in the case of such an event.  The prime minister insisted his plan to replace the Irish backstop, which involves a customs union between the United Kingdom and the bloc in order to avoid a hard Irish border, would ""in no circumstances"" result in checks at or near the border of Northern Ireland - though he did not define ""near"".  ""Today in Brussels we are tabling what I believe are constructive and reasonable proposals which provide a compromise for both sides,"" he told the party faithful in Manchester, having skipped what have certainly been a hostile House of Commons at Prime Minister's Questions.  ""We will under no circumstances have checks at or near the border in Northern Ireland. We will respect the peace process and the Good Friday agreement,"" he said, referring to a 1998 deal that ended decades of violence.  ""And by a process of renewable democratic consent by the executive and assembly of Northern Ireland we will go further and protect the existing regulatory arrangements for farmers and other businesses on both sides of the border.  ""And at the same time, we will allow the UK - whole and entire - to withdraw from the EU, with control of our own trade policy from the start.""  Johnson will speak to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday afternoon, but the commission said it would not ""pre-empt any reaction"" before having a chance to study the proposals to replace the backstop, which was a part of a deal the EU reached with Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May.  'Compromise'  Johnson said his ""plan"" - on which the speech itself was light on detail - represented a ""compromise by the UK"".  ""I hope very much that our friends understand that and compromise in their turn,"" he told the conference.  ""Because if we fail to get an agreement because of what is essentially a technical discussion of the exact nature of future customs checks, when that technology is improving the whole time, then let us be in no doubt that the alternative is no deal.  ""That is not an outcome we want. It is not an outcome we seek at all. But ... it is an outcome for which we are ready.""  Not one border but two  British officials have described the texts being presented to the EU as a ""final offer"" - but observers say Johnson is hoping to start a new conversation.  190929085456972  ""Crucially, both the ERG [an influential Tory Eurosceptic faction] and the DUP [Northern Irish conservatives] are on board with this new Brexit plan,"" tweeted Sebastian Payne, the Financial Times Whitehall correspondent. ""No10 hopes to use this unity to show the EU that if they engage with the Brexit proposals, a deal can get through Parliament.""  The plan, according to leaked reports, involves creating not one hard border, but two ""soft"" borders - a regulatory border between Britain and Northern Ireland in the Irish Sea for four years and customs checks between the North and the Irish Republic.  For decades before the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, customs posts have been targeted by Republican hardliners. Their presence provides a tangible representation of armed British forces on the island of Ireland. The worry is that attacks on customs checkpoints would lead to the British military being deployed to defend them, and the whole spiral of violence then beginning again.  Simon Coveney, Ireland's deputy prime minister, said late on Tuesday that Johnson's idea was ""no basis for an agreement"", calling it ""concerning, to say the least"".  Targeting opposition  In Manchester, Johnson told the conference that people felt they were being ""taken for fools"" by Westminster's failure to honour the result of the 2016 referendum and warned of ""grave consequences"" if Brexit was not delivered.  Moving away from Brexit, Johnson trumpeted the achievements and potential of British industry, citing the UK's national nuclear fusion research centre, and saying how it was ""on the verge"" of supplying nuclear fusion energy to the world. Fusion, the process which powers the sun, is considered the ""holy grail"" of energy sources, and experts say a breakthrough which would lead to commercial distribution is decades away.  Johnson also failed to mention that the research centre, at Culham in Oxfordshire, is part-funded by the EU's EuroFusion consortium, with the Euratom agency funding the landmark, world-leading JET project in its entirety.  190722183952925  He went on to insist the Conservatives were ""the party of the NHS"" while also solving ""the problem of social care"", although he did not set out how. The National Health Service (NHS) was founded by in 1948 by a Labour government - Labour is now the country's main opposition party and is led by Jeremy Corbyn.  During his keynote speech, Johnson branded Corbyn's Labour a party of ""fratricidal, anti-Semitic Marxists"".  ""If Jeremy Corbyn were allowed into Downing Street, he would whack up your taxes, he would foul up the economy, he would rip up the alliance between Britain and the USA and he would break up the UK,"" Johnson said. ""We cannot allow it to happen.""  Corbyn wants to increase taxes on corporations and high earners, nationalise water, gas and rail companies, strengthen trade unions and hand 10 percent of company shares to workers.  A new poll of 1,011 UK adults by UnHerd Insight found 60 percent are in favour of the nationalisation of rail companies; among Labour voters the figure rise to more than 80 percent. There is also strong general public support for the nationalisation of water (55 percent), electricity (52 percent) and gas (51 percent).  'I'm a Celebrity'  Back in the conference hall in Manchester, Johnson ranted against parliament, which he unlawfully suspended last month after a series of humiliating defeats, before the highest court in the land unanimously forced the legislature's reopening, delivering another blow to the prime minister.  If Parliament were a school, inspectors ""would be shutting it down"", and if it were a reality TV show ""the whole lot of us would have been voted out of the jungle,"" he said.  ""The sad truth is that voters have more say over I'm a Celebrity than they do over this House of Commons,"" Johnson added.  The prime minister has lost his ability to govern through Parliament after sacking a ""rebel alliance"" of 21 MPs who voted against the government on the bill which compels the prime minister to seek a Brexit extension.",0
19,brexit countdown_bg Created with Sketch.,19," The Pound has risen against the Dollar after Boris Johnson gave a barnstorming speech at the Tory conference calling for no more delays to Brexit.  The Prime Minister addressed Conservatives in Manchester today and tore into Remainer MPs, describing Parliament as a 'pebble in the shoe' of the nation.  He again made clear that he will not beg Brussels for an extension - suggesting the EU must accept his new 'compromise' proposals or face No Deal.  Despite his threats of a No Deal, which economists have claimed would be a disaster for the British economy, the Pound experienced a surge following Boris's speech.  Currency data shows the Pound shot up against the US Dollar from 1.2254 at 12.41pm to 1.2296 at 12.53pm.  The surge is some comeback for the Pound, which fell to 1.1199 against the Euro yesterday when Boris announced his 'final' Brexit deal, but is now at 1.1240.  In his keynote speech at the Conservative Party conference Mr Johnson insisted his plan to replace the Irish backstop would 'in no circumstances' result in checks at or near the border in Northern Ireland.  Shortly after his speech, the Pound shot up against the US Dollar from 1.2254 at 12.41pm to 1.2296 at 12.53pm  Addressing party conference for the first time as PM, Mr Johnson again made clear that he will not beg Brussels for an extension - saying they must choose between his new 'compromise' plan and No Deal  Mr Johnson said: 'Today in Brussels we are tabling what I believe are constructive and reasonable proposals which provide a compromise for both sides.  'We will under no circumstances have checks at or near the border in Northern Ireland. We will respect the peace process and the Good Friday agreement.  'And by a process of renewable democratic consent by the executive and assembly of Northern Ireland we will go further and protect the existing regulatory arrangements for farmers and other businesses on both sides of the border.  'And at the same time we will allow the UK - whole and entire - to withdraw from the EU, with control of our own trade policy from the start.'  Mr Johnson acknowledged the plan represented a 'compromise by the UK'.  'I hope very much that our friends understand that and compromise in their turn,' he told the Manchester conference.  'Because if we fail to get an agreement because of what is essentially a technical discussion of the exact nature of future customs checks, when that technology is improving the whole time, then let us be in no doubt that the alternative is no deal.

British officials have made clear to EU counterparts that the legal texts being presented to the European Union are a final offer and unless Brussels is prepared to engage there will be no more talks until after Brexit.  The plan involves a 'two borders for four years' measure that will leave Northern Ireland in a relationship with Europe until 2025, according to The Daily Telegraph.  It accepts the need for both a regulatory border between Britain and Northern Ireland in the Irish Sea for four years and customs checks between the North and the Irish Republic.  Ireland's deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, speaking late on Tuesday night, said this was 'no basis for an agreement' and 'concerning to say the least'.  Mr Johnson will speak to European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday afternoon to discuss the Prime Minister's Brexit plan.  The commission said it will not 'pre-empt any reaction' before having a chance to study the proposals to replace the backstop.  Mr Johnson told the conference 'we can, we must and we will' get Brexit done.  Despite the 'Surrender Bill' - the legislation passed into law aimed at blocking the Prime Minister from taking the UK out of the EU without a deal unless he has the consent of MPs - Mr Johnson insisted he would meet the October 31 deadline 'come what may'.",0
15,Image copyright AFP/Getty Images,15," The government has delivered its new Brexit proposals to the EU, including plans to replace the Irish backstop.  The plan, outlined in a seven-page document, would see Northern Ireland stay in the European single market for goods, but leave the customs union - resulting in new customs checks.  The Northern Ireland Assembly would get to approve the arrangements first and vote every four years on keeping them.  The European Commission said there had been progress but ""problems"" remained.  Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said the new blueprint did not ""fully meet the agreed objectives of the backstop"", in terms of upholding the EU's single market, protecting peace in Northern Ireland and supporting economic co-operation with the Republic of Ireland.  But he said he wanted an agreement and talks would continue.  The UK is set to leave the EU on 31 October and the government has insisted it will not negotiate a further delay beyond the Halloween deadline.  Speaking at the Conservative Party conference earlier on Wednesday, Boris Johnson said the only alternative to his Brexit plan was no-deal.

Government sources hoped the UK might be able to enter an intense 10-day period of negotiations with the EU almost immediately, with the aim of coming to a final agreement at an EU summit on 17 October.  Mr Juncker welcomed what he said were ""positive advances"" in some areas but he said the UK's proposed system of ""governance"" of the new arrangements was ""problematic"" - and customs rules remained a concern.

Jean-Claude Juncker spoke today of ""concerns"" arising from the text but EU leaders won't want to be seen to be the ones closing the door to a deal.  Throughout the Brexit process they've repeatedly kicked the ball back into the UK government's court.  On cue, leaders are ""welcoming the delivery of the proposals from the government"" and inviting the prime minister to continue negotiations.  The fundamental questions for the EU remain: How much does does the prime minister really want a deal? Is he willing to move from his apparent ""take it or leave it"" position?  If he is, there will be something to talk about. If not, the EU will try its best to avoid being the ones to say ""forget it"".  But Mr Johnson should think again if he imagines his proposals, which do include concessions from his side, will prompt EU countries with a lot to lose in a no deal Brexit (like Germany) to try to force Ireland to accept his offer.  Angela Merkel today insisted EU leaders would stick together. With such an important EU member leaving, Mrs Merkel believes unity amongst those left behind is paramount.  Arlene Foster, leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, supported the plan, saying it would allow Northern Ireland to leave the customs union and single market at the same time as the rest of the UK.  Several Conservative MPs who opposed Theresa May's agreement also signalled their likely support, with leading Brexiteer Steve Baker saying he was ""cautiously optimistic"".

What is in the proposals?  The prime minister has set out details of his plan to replace the Irish border ""backstop"" in the current Brexit agreement.  The backstop is the controversial ""insurance policy"" that is meant to keep a free-flowing border on the island of Ireland but which critics - including the PM - fear could trap the UK in EU trading rules indefinitely.  Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU:  Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021  But Northern Ireland would, with the consent of politicians in the Northern Ireland Assembly, continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products - what he calls an ""all-island regulatory zone""  This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years  Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks  These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain""  The government is also promising a ""New Deal for Northern Ireland"", with financial commitments to help manage the changes.

24,Latest Brexit plan for Boris to squeeze Barnier’s thigh under the negotiating table in attempt to get deal,24," Boris to grope Barnier The Prime Minister will avoid a further extension to the Brexit deadline by going to Brussels and doing what he does best – letting his wandering hands work their magic.  Details of the UK’s proposals for reaching a Brexit deal have been revealed – the Prime Minister is all set to sexually assault Michel Barnier.  “The PM knows exactly what Barnier wants, and he’s man enough to give it to him,” said a Downing Street spokesman.  “Theresa was never bold enough, but Boris has no such inhibitions.”  The Prime Minister suggested that all this Irish backstop nonsense was simply part of a prolonged mating ritual.  “Michel, my belle,” he said. “What a tease he is! He’s been playing hard to get but he’s absolutely gagging for it – I have an excellent nose for these things.  “Barnier normally starts negotiating sessions by sitting opposite me so I’ll start off with a classic bit of footsie. That will encourage him to move seats after the coffee break and take his place by my side.  “As everyone knows, sitting next to somebody is another way of saying, ‘touch me anywhere you like big boy!’  “And I will! I’ll squeeze his juicy thigh through the deliciously tight trousers he always wears especially for my benefit. His crotch will be my oyster!  “I’ll negotiate him like he’s never been negotiated before – he’ll get a satisfying deal all right.  “Hootchie cootchie!”",1
30,Brexit 50p coin already worth only 20p,30," Brexit 50p released The commemorative 50p coin that Sajid Javid is hoping to release in time for Brexit is already worth only 20p, according to economists.  The coin, which will be issued to mark the UK’s departure from the European Union on 31st October, and will seek to forever remind the British population of that glorious moment it took a metaphorical shotgun to both feet, will look like a normal 50p but will also have a daft platitude inscribed on it.  According to reports, the coin will feature the Queen’s head and the date 31 October 2019 and on the reverse the phrase “Friendship with all nations”, which presumably is an intentionally ironic reference to Britain sticking two fingers up at every country it has ever been good friends with over the last twenty years.  Economist Simon Williams explained, “The chancellor has made a shrewd move in choosing the 50p coin as the value with which to make a commemorative Brexit coin, as it can’t drop too much value, worst case – each one loses 50p, which isn’t the end of the world.  “With a deal with the EU now a dwindling possibility, the value of the coin is currently around 20p, but in the event of a no deal situation, the value could drop to 10p, or even lower if we crash out in acrimonious circumstances.  “And Mr Javid will be thankful that it’s currently valued at 20p, that’s actually quite a ringing endorsement of his government.”  It is understood that the coin will be blue in colour, as that sort of thing seems to please some of the population.",1
10,"The U.K. offered the European Union a proposed last-minute Brexit deal on Wednesday that it said represents a realistic compromise for both sides, as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged the bloc to hold “rapid negotiations towards a solution” after years of wrangling.",10," Interested in Brexit? Add Brexit as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Brexit news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest  With Britain due to leave the bloc at the end of this month, Johnson said in a letter to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker that not reaching a deal would be “a failure of statecraft for which we would all be responsible.” He did not mention that the EU and the U.K. did reach a deal in 2018 — only for it to be rejected, three times, by Britain’s Parliament.  The EU gave the proposals a guarded welcome and said the two sides would negotiate over the coming days. Juncker said he welcomed Johnson's ""determination"" to make progress but noted there were still some ""problematic"" areas. Finland, which currently holds the EU presidency, said the 27 other member states would “engage actively” with the U.K. proposals, and chief negotiator Michel Barnier said they represented “progress.”  The new proposals focus on maintaining an open border between the U.K.’s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland — the key sticking point to a Brexit deal. The U.K. proposes to do that by keeping Northern Ireland closely aligned to EU rules for trade in goods, possibly for an extended period.  The proposals, and Johnson’s letter, were conciliatory, despite having been billed by Johnson’s office as a take-it-or-leave it “final offer.”  Instead, Johnson used a speech to his Conservative Party to implore the bloc, and Britons, to end more than three years of acrimonious wrangling over the terms of the U.K.’s exit from the EU.  “Let’s get Brexit done,” was the repeated refrain to delegates at the conference in Manchester, northwest England.  British voters in 2016 narrowly chose to leave the EU but the country remains deeply divided over how to do it. In his speech, Johnson said people who voted for Brexit “are beginning to feel that they are being taken for fools."" He warned of “grave consequences for trust in our democracy” if Britain did not leave the EU on the scheduled date of Oct. 31.  He said the government was offering “constructive and reasonable proposals” to the EU.  The plan is “a compromise by the U.K. And I hope very much that our friends understand that and compromise in their turn,” Johnson said.  But the plan is likely to face deep skepticism from EU leaders, who will need to be convinced the U.K. has a workable proposal to avoid checks on goods or people crossing the Irish border.  A Brexit agreement between the EU and Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, was rejected by the U.K. Parliament, largely because of opposition to the ""backstop,"" an insurance policy designed to ensure there is no return to customs posts or other infrastructure on the Irish border.  An open border underpins both the local economy and Northern Ireland's peace process. But Johnson and other British Brexit supporters oppose the backstop because it would keep the U.K. tightly bound to EU trade rules in order to avoid customs checks — limiting the country's ability to strike new trade deals around the world.  Johnson insisted that “we will under no circumstances have checks at or near the border in Northern Ireland.""  The British proposal involves “an all-island regulatory zone on the island of Ireland, covering all goods including agrifood.” That would keep Northern Ireland in a regulatory zone with the EU for food, agricultural and industrial products, removing the need for checks.  The U.K. proposal does not put a time limit on that status, though it would have to be renewed every four years by the Northern Ireland Assembly. However, that assembly has been suspended for more than two years by a dispute between the main Unionist and Nationalist power-sharing parties.  Under the plan there would still need to be customs checks, but Johnson suggested they could be carried out away from the border at “other points on the supply chain.”  The Irish government said Prime Minister Leo Varadkar spoke to Johnson by phone on Wednesday. It said that while ""the proposals do not fully meet the agreed objectives of the backstop,"" Varadkar would ""study them in further detail.""  Johnson has vowed that Britain will leave on Oct. 31, with or without a Brexit deal.  In Wednesday’s speech he repeated his contention that the U.K. can handle any bumps that come from tumbling out of the bloc without a deal, which would mean the instant imposition of customs checks and other barriers between Britain and the EU, its biggest trading partner.  A no-deal Brexit is ""not an outcome we want ... (but) it is an outcome for which we are ready,"" he said.  But the U.K. government and businesses both say the disruptions would be substantial, with the flow of goods coming into Britain through the major Channel port of Dover cut in half.  Many lawmakers want to prevent a no-deal exit, and have passed a law that compels the government to seek a delay to Brexit if it can't get an agreement with the EU by Oct. 19. Johnson says he won’t do that — although he also insists he will obey the law. He has not explained how doing both will be possible.  Johnson also suffered a major setback when the U.K. Supreme Court ruled last week that his attempt to shut down Parliament for five weeks was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating Parliament’s ability to scrutinize the government’s Brexit plan.  The British government said Wednesday it will ask Queen Elizabeth II to suspend Parliament again next week — but just for a few days ahead of a speech on Oct. 14 laying out the administration’s plans. A short suspension of that kind is routine and usually happens about once a year.  Johnson, who has had a tumultuous 70 days in office, is eager to refocus attention away from Brexit. On Wednesday he delivered a speech peppered with puns, grand claims about Britain’s greatness and jokes at the expense of his opponents — chiefly left-wing Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, whom he dubbed a “communist cosmonaut.”  It was also, pointedly, a pre-election speech, with a grab-bag of promises: more money for hospitals and police, unspecified tax cuts, greener buses and faster internet access.  The brash Brexit champion is popular with many Conservatives, who welcome his energy and optimism after three years of Brexit gridlock under May. Some, though, have qualms about his personal conduct and his divisive tactics, which include using words like ""surrender"" and ""betrayal"" about opponents of Brexit.  He has been dogged by allegations that he handed out perks to a female friend's business while he was mayor of London and groped the thigh of a female journalist at a lunch two decades ago. Johnson denies impropriety in both cases.  The claims have not dented his popularity among many Conservatives.  “We don’t need Saint Boris, thank you,” said Jean Chesworth, a delegate from Newcastle-under-Lyme in central England. “We’re none of us saints. We can all look at the skeletons in our cupboards.”  ———  Kirka reported from London.

26,Boris Johnson hails successful trial of post-Brexit rolling power blackouts,26," Boris Johnson on power cuts One million people were left without power for much of yesterday and survived, an experience which the Prime Minister has said bodes extremely well for life in Brexit Britain.  Train passengers were stranded, traffic lights failed to work and thousands of homes were plunged into darkness during the blackout.  “These rolling power blackouts will be commonplace after Brexit,” said Boris Johnson to reporters this morning.  “So having these trial runs will put us all in good stead for life as an independent nation. With a bit of mental gymnastics, you could almost view them as one of the Brexit dividends. Somehow.  “During these times our carbon footprint will be reduced, and no-one died yesterday, did they?”  He concluded, “There’s no harm to be had in fumbling around blindly in the dark, unless of course you’re making love to one of your mistresses and can’t find a condom – but enough about my private life.”  Scotland was completely unaffected by the power outage yesterday, which provided a strong metaphor for those calling for IndyRef2.",1

After a century of building up what they see as a ‘level of credibility’, the KKK is concerned that an association with the likes of Iain Duncan Smith, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson could leave their reputations in tatters.  Current Klan Grand Wizard Billy-Bob Williams was the most vocal in his rejection of the ideals of the hard Brexiters.  He told reporters, “We in the KKK have a long and glorious tradition of being associated with petty mindedness, bigotry and racism – so to see us being associated with such simpletons and liars is of great offence to us as an organisation.  “We have great belief in our mission, we are not in it just to try and make a few bucks. Frankly, we’re pretty sure even ERG doesn’t believe what they’re saying these days.  We might be racist nutjobs, but even we can see Brexit is a terrible idea.  “And dropping clues you might be racist to get racists to vote for you? That’s low man. They’re making those of us that genuinely don’t like immigrants – and are happy saying it publicly – look really bad. Own it, for f*cks sake!”  Billy-Bob was asked if there were any current British politicians he actually admired, to which he answered “very few”.  “That said,” he added, “I really liked Theresa May’s ‘go home’ immigrant vans from a few years ago.

However, the Irish prime minister said the proposals ""do not fully meet the agreed objectives of the backstop"" - the mechanism they seek to replace.  After speaking with Boris Johnson on Wednesday evening, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar indicated ""he would study them in further detail and would consult with the EU institutions, including the Task Force and our EU partners"".  The two prime ministers agreed to talk again next week.

The government plan, outlined in a seven-page document published on Wednesday, would see Northern Ireland stay in the European single market for goods, but leave the customs union - resulting in new customs checks.  The Northern Ireland Assembly would get to approve the arrangements first and vote every four years on keeping them.

""This is a serious and sensible way forward to have engagement with the European Union in a way that allows us all in the United Kingdom to leave the EU,"" she added.  Image copyright AFP/Getty  The UK proposal is that a revived Stormont Assembly and Executive would have to give their consent for the trade arrangements to come into force before the end of a transition period, which is due to last until 2021.  That consent would then have to be renewed every four years.  Under Assembly cross-community voting rules this would give both unionists and nationalists a veto over aligning with the EU.  If the Assembly withheld its consent, Northern Ireland would revert to the trade regulations which apply elsewhere in the UK.  If the arrangements are approved by the Assembly and Executive, Northern Ireland would adopt EU trade regulations.  However, under the UK proposal it would remain within the UK customs territory meaning there will be a requirement for some customs checks on goods moving across the border.

There would be additional checks on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, but the UK would not apply further checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Ireland.  Checks relating to the single market are about product standards, to ensure goods comply with EU regulations.  However, Northern Ireland would leave the EU customs union with the rest of the UK, so there would have to be new customs checks between North and South.  Those checks would look at customs documents and the payment of tariffs, which allow goods to cross the border in the first place.  The government proposals suggest the vast majority of checks could be carried out electronically - but thinks a small number of physical checks would have to take place, either at business premises or at points on the supply chain.

5,The Latest on Brexit and British politics (all times local):,5," 7:10 p.m.  The European Parliament’s chief Brexit official said the British government’s new Brexit plan does not give Ireland sufficient guarantees.  European lawmakers need to approve any Brexit deal, and its top legislators assessed Wednesday’s new proposals from Britain with the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.  Afterward, Belgian MEP Guy Verhofstadt said “the first assessment of nearly every member in the Brexit Steering Group was not positive.”  He said the group would flesh out objections on Thursday.  The main sticking point between the EU and Britain has centered on the border on the island of Ireland. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has insisted that a previously agreed insurance measure to make sure no hard border emerges between EU member state Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K., is ditched.  The plan he’s sent over to Brussels ditches that so-called backstop agreement in favor of new customs arrangements.  ———  6:30 p.m.  The British government says it will ask Queen Elizabeth II to suspend Parliament for a few days next week ahead of a speech laying out the administration’s plans.  The move comes over a week after the U.K. Supreme Court ruled an earlier five-week shutdown of the legislature unlawful. In that case, the court said the suspension had the effect of frustrating Parliament’s ability to scrutinize the government’s Brexit plan.  The new proposal is likely to be far less controversial. The government wants Parliament to break from Tuesday evening until Monday, Oct, 14, when the government will launch a new session and a fresh legislative program with a Queen’s Speech.  A short suspension of that kind is routine and usually happens about once a year.  ———  6 p.m.  The European Union’s Brexit negotiator says that the Brexit proposals of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson constitute “progress” that finally opens up room for negotiations before the crucial EU summit in two weeks’ time.  Michel Barnier said though that the gap between both sides remains daunting and “to be frank lots of work still needs to be done” to meet the three key conditions of the EU.  The border on the island of Ireland remains the key sticking point and the EU is insistent it remains transparent and open, that any deal doesn’t hamper the seamless economic cooperation between the EU’s Ireland and the U.K.’s Northern Ireland and that any border deal respects the rules of the EU internal market.  Barnier said “we will continue to work, to work to reach a deal. The ‘no-deal’ will never be the choice of the EU, never.”  ———  5:30 p.m.  The European Union presidency says that the 27 member states are ready to look at British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s proposals “constructively.”  Finland, which currently holds the EU rotating presidency, said that the European Commission led by Jean-Claude Juncker will assess the proposals “and is ready to engage actively.”  The statement added that “the EU 27 will stay united” during the upcoming negotiations.  ———  5:05 p.m.  EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has welcomed British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s “determination” to advance Brexit talks and said negotiations on Johnson’s new withdrawal deal proposal would take place “over coming days.”  Despite a yawning gap between the two sides, the European Commission said Juncker “acknowledged the positive advances” in some of the proposals Johnson submitted on Wednesday.  At the same time, the commission said “the president noted that there are still some problematic points that will need further work in the coming days.”  If there is to be any divorce deal before the U.K. leaves the EU as scheduled on Oct. 31, both sides have said they would need to reach an agreement by the time an EU summit set for Oct. 17-18 EU summit ends.  Johnson said in his letter to Juncker that his proposals “provide a basis for rapid negotiations.” In his reply, Juncker has left the door open for a solution to be found that resolves remaining differences.  ———  3:20 p.m.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel says she can’t comment yet on the new Brexit proposals put forward by the U.K. government but is stressing the importance of the 27 remaining EU countries maintaining a united front.  Britain’s Brexit envoy was in Brussels Wednesday to deliver Prime Minister Boris Johnson's proposal for kick-starting negotiations on a divorce deal. Johnson said it represents a reasonable compromise for both the U.K. and the E.U.  Merkel said at a news conference in Berlin with visiting Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte: “We will look carefully at the proposals. I can’t say anything about them yet today.”  She added that “for us, it is very important that we as 27 (countries) stick together. We trust in (EU negotiator) Michel Barnier, and we will discuss it further.”  ———  3:15 p.m.  Britain has sent its proposals for a Brexit deal to leaders of the European Union, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson urging “rapid negotiations towards a solution.”  The proposals submitted on Wednesday focus on maintaining an open border between the U.K.’s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland - the key sticking point to a Brexit deal.  Johnsons says in a letter to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker that the U.K. proposes to do that by keeping Northern Ireland closely aligned to EU rules for trade in goods, possibly for an extended period.  He says not reaching a deal would be “a failure of statecraft for which we would all be responsible.”  ———  2:05 p.m.  British Brexit envoy David Frost has arrived at the European Union’s headquarters in Brussels to deliver Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s proposal for kick-starting stalled negotiations on a divorce deal.  Carrying a black leather portfolio, Frost did not speak to the media as he entered the Berlaymont Commission building.  The EU’s Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, plans to make a first assessment of the document to see if Johnson’s proposal is a basis for late-hour negotiations. Barnier then will take it to the European Parliament’s experts and the ambassadors of the 27 EU nations for further discussion.  EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker will also have a first look at the proposal that centers on how to manage the border on the island of Ireland. Juncker expects to have a telephone call with Johnson to discuss future talks.  ———  1:50 p.m.  The European Union has approved Brexit preparedness measures to soften the financial blow to workers in the bloc’s remaining countries in case Britain leaves in a chaotic and costly no-deal scenario.  Finnish Employment Minister Timo Harakka said Wednesday that “these measures will ensure that anyone who loses their job as a result of hard Brexit will not be let down.” Finland currently holds the rotating EU presidency.  The measures would allow such workers to get financial aid from a fund that helps EU citizens losing their jobs as “a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns.” A no-deal Brexit meets those standards for getting aid from the European Globalization Adjustment Fund.  No other financial details were immediately available.  Harakka said: “Solidarity is a core value of the EU, and we have to make sure that in the event of major economic disruption, nobody is left behind.""  ———  12:25 p.m.  The European Union says it will give any proposal from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson serious legal vetting before saying whether it is worthy of being a basis for future talks on the U.K.’s departure from the EU.  The European Commission said in a statement that “once received, we will examine [the UK text] objectively & in light of well-known criteria,” which includes whether it prevents a hard border on the island of Ireland, preserves cooperation between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and respects the EU rules on trade across borders.  European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is set to speak with Johnson in the afternoon and technical talks among both sides are also set up.  ———  11:55 a.m.  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says there will be ""grave consequences for trust in our democracy"" if Brexit is delayed beyond Oct. 31 and vows there will be no custom checks at the Northern Ireland border.  Britain narrowly voted in 2016 to leave the EU but remains deeply divided over the departure terms.  The comments came as Johnson described his offer for Brexit deal to the European Union on Wednesday, as the date for Britain's departure from the bloc looms.  Johnson insisted that “under no circumstances “would there be customs checks at the border in Northern Ireland under the proposed deal, one of the main sticking points of talks.  Johnson says the proposal is a ""constructive and reasonable compromise,"" but it's likely to face deep skepticism from EU leaders, who doubt the U.K. has a workable plan to avoid checks on goods or people crossing the border between EU member Ireland and the U.K.'s Northern Ireland after Brexit.  ———  8:05 a.m.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson will send what he says is the U.K.'s ""final offer"" for a Brexit deal to the European Union, with the date set for Britain's departure less than a month away.  Johnson says the proposal is a ""fair and reasonable compromise."" But it is likely to face skepticism from EU leaders, who doubt the U.K. has a workable plan to avoid border checks between EU member Ireland and the U.K.'s Northern Ireland.  The British government says it will send the proposals to Brussels after Johnson closes his Conservative Party's annual conference on Wednesday. Johnson says he'll walk away from talks if the EU refuses to ""engage"" with the U.K. plan.  Johnson insists Britain must leave the EU on Oct. 31, with or without a deal.  ———  Follow AP's full coverage of Brexit and British politics at: https://www.apnews.com/Brexit",0
20,Jeremy Corbyn finally joins Brexit debate to come down firmly on the side of making Jeremy Corbyn prime minister,20," Jeremy Corbyn wants to be prime minister A highly anticipated press conference by the Labour leader caused a seismic shock as Jeremy Corbyn ended two years of Brexit prevarication and finally declared that he would throw his full support behind a brilliant solution based on him moving into Downing Street.  He explained his plan to the gathered reporters, telling them,  “The Tories have failed to deliver on their promises. They have made a mess of Brexit. Labour’s plan will solve all the thorny questions by having me put a painting of Tony Benn in the Cabinet Office.  “We are certain that the question of the hard border in Northern Ireland can be solved by me offering a Miners Union banner to Lea Varadkar. All will be well when I am in charge.”  However, some doubts were raised as to Jeremy Corbyn’s ability to negotiate a better deal as explained Sigmund Wilhelms, the EU’s special commissioner on Brexit.  He told us, “Why does this man believe we will change our red lines for him? The truth is we really don’t care that much who is doing the negotiating.  “We think in terms of policies, funding and regulatory implications. You might also want to tell him that nearly all the key players in the EU are centre-right so trying to sway them by whistling the Red Flag is not the best tactic.  “Although if he does become PM please smarten him up. If he comes to Brussels looking like he does now, the security staff are just going to assume he’s a lonely widower trying to get out of the wind and give him some soup.  “He looks like he enjoys soup.”",1

Let’s see if we can break it down for you.    Boris Johnson’s new Brexit plan would see Northern Ireland stick to the European Union’s strict regulations on agriculture, food, and all goods, while the rest of the UK could go off and set its own. Tap to play or pause GIF Tap to play or pause GIF Tap to play or pause GIF Tap to play or pause GIF reddit.com  However, Northern Ireland would at the same time leave the EU's customs territory and tax regime, which creates an old-school customs border. That requires checks. However, Johnson wants the checks to take place away from the actual border with the Republic of Ireland.  His plan would also make Northern Ireland's executive – which has not sat for two and a half years, and that’s a whole other story – and its assembly to agree to the arrangements every four years. Tap to play or pause GIF Tap to play or pause GIF Tap to play or pause GIF Tap to play or pause GIF 21st Century Fox  Government officials insist Johnson’s new proposal is serious and that means a significant compromise from the UK. They insist this is the UK’s final offer, and if the EU is not willing to consider it, the prime minister will go all out for a no-deal Brexit. Tap to play or pause GIF Tap to play or pause GIF Tap to play or pause GIF Tap to play or pause GIF BBC  “This will be the final offer,” Downing Street briefed journalists on Tuesday night.  But elsewhere, the government’s stance is that of a shifty guy winking with his fingers crossed behind his back. For a start, many, not least on the Northern Irish side, are dubious about the practicalities of the plan as it stands.  The Boris plan unveiled today means Tariffs N to S meaning farms and agri food will be decimated. Also means 2 borders requiring renewal after 4 years, surveillance in border communities without their consent, checks N/S and W/E, no exemptions, no market access and import VAT.  In a pre-speech interview in the Sun, Johnson said he would look at any counteroffer made by the EU, but in his conference speech, there was no attempt to claim this was “the final offer”.    Johnson’s allies are privately conceding that what they send to Brussels is extremely unlikely to be accepted. But they also insist they’re not deliberately giving the European Union something they know they will reject out of hand, that would give them a convenient excuse to pursue no deal. Christopher Furlong / Getty Images  The preference, according to government sources, is for the European Union to engage in further talks over the next few days and see if a compromise can be found. They just can’t get a flat no.    At the same time, with all this going on — and MPs talking openly about the death threats they receive — there are grim warnings from “government insiders” about things worsening if there were a second referendum. Jeff J Mitchell / Getty Images Boris Johnson's senior adviser Dominic Cummings (centre) at the Tory party conference.  SO. That’s the first layer of all the scheming. Here’s the second: As things stand, the most likely outcome is that the UK and the EU do not reach an agreement. Tap to play or pause GIF Tap to play or pause GIF Tap to play or pause GIF Tap to play or pause GIF reddit.com  Now, Johnson has insisted that he won’t seek a Brexit delay by sending a letter to the EU requesting another extension. But if you remember, the so-called “Benn Act” passed by Parliament last month demanded that the government must send the extension letter if a deal is not agreed by Oct. 19. Johnson’s aides insist he will find a way of trying to prevent an extension by going “straight through” the Benn Act — that is, convincing the EU not to agree to an extension. Remember, the EU has said it would only agree to an extension if Johnson asked for it, and with a clear reason — for example, an election. And if Johnson doesn’t ask, he will likely end up in court.  That’s why many in government are privately urging the prime minister that he should do everything he can to show he doesn’t want to delay Brexit. If he can show that he was forced into it by Parliament and the courts, the thinking goes, he can agree only to a short delay.

12,Image copyright AFP,12," Boris Johnson has outlined his plan to the European Union (EU) to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit.  Mr Johnson said the plan ""removes the so-called backstop"".  The backstop is the insurance policy negotiated by Theresa May and the EU. It is designed to avoid any physical border infrastructure, which it is feared would bring back memories of the Troubles, after Brexit.  It would keep the UK in the same customs territory as the EU, and Northern Ireland closely tied to EU regulations - until the UK and the EU reach a trade deal.  But it would stop the UK striking its own trade deals, which is why so many Conservative MPs, including Mr Johnson, oppose the backstop.  So, what is his alternative?  Customs union  The government wants the UK to leave the EU customs union. This would mean Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland ending up in two different customs territories.  This means lorries entering the Republic of Ireland from Northern Ireland will need to complete customs declarations. This is to ensure the correct tariffs (tax on imports) are paid when UK goods enter the EU customs union.  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics.  Reality Check's Chris Morris: From the beginning the EU has struggled to see how Ireland and Northern Ireland can exist in different customs territories while keeping the border as open as it is now under all circumstances. They will argue that - in the absence of a future free trade deal - this proposal means the UK is breaking commitments it has made about the border. The UK counters that the backstop has already been rejected in Parliament three times, and something needs to change.  Customs checks  Instead of installing customs posts and other physical infrastructure at the Irish border, the UK says declarations should be done electronically.  The government says physical checks would still be needed ""on a very small proportion of movements"". Currently, about one in 100 consignments entering the EU customs union are inspected to check that the goods match the information on the declaration.  These inspections could be carried out at warehouses or ""designated locations, which could be located anywhere in Ireland or Northern Ireland.""  The government's proposal does not spell out what these ""designated locations"" would look like, but it adds there should be ""a firm commitment (by both parties) never to conduct checks at the border in future"".  If adopted, a border solution relying on technology and remote checks would be a first. The EU does not currently share a single border with a non-EU country where checks have been completely eliminated.  That includes Norway (not in the EU) and Sweden (an EU member) - which share one of the most technologically advanced borders in the world. Their main crossing point processes about 1,300 lorries a day, with each waiting 20 minutes on average.  The EU has previously rejected a customs solution that relies on technology.  Back in January, Sabine Weyand, the EU's director-general for trade, said: ""We looked at every border on this Earth, every border the EU has with a third country - there's simply no way you can do away with checks and controls.""  The government says that some small traders should be exempt from paying duty. However, the document does not address smuggling head on. In other words, what will be done to detect and prevent traders, who should be paying duty, from crossing the border without completing custom declarations first?  Reality Check's Chris Morris: The EU will see much of this as a rehash of previous ideas that it doesn't think will work. And many people will worry that unspecified ""designated locations"" could become targets for anyone seeking to undermine the Northern Ireland peace process. The EU will push back hard against suggestions that it needs to revise its own customs rules to suit the UK.  Regulations on goods  When it comes to the regulation of goods, Northern Ireland would keep to the rules of the EU's single market, rather than UK rules.  That removes the need for product standard and safety checks on goods at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, because both will be part of an ""all-island regulatory zone"".  But it creates the need for checks between the rest of the UK - which will not be sticking to EU single market rules - and Northern Ireland..  All agricultural, food or animal products entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK will have to go through a Border Inspection Post. That's a bit of infrastructure where goods can be physically examined and paperwork checked.  Manufactured goods in Northern Ireland would also have to keep to EU rules, and these goods would be checked ""at the boundary of the zone"" - presumably at crossings between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, on the Irish Sea.  Reality Check's Chris Morris: This is quite a big concession from the UK side - basically accepting that there would have to be quite intrusive checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK for a number of years, on things like product standards and food safety. The EU has always said there have to be checks carried out somewhere, and both sides will try to deny any suggestion that this amounts to a new border in the Irish Sea.  Stormont's say  Having Northern Ireland following EU rules for the production of goods over which it has no say is, as the document says, ""a significant democratic problem"".  As a result, it is proposed that the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive will have to sign off on the plan before it takes effect.  The Northern Irish institutions will be asked to approve the plan again every four years, and if they do not then Northern Ireland would stop following EU rules one year later.  The Northern Ireland Assembly has not met since early 2017.  Reality Check's Chris Morris: The issue of democratic legitimacy is a crucial one, but it cannot be applied unevenly. The EU is likely to have a problem with anything which suggests that only Northern Ireland could have - in effect - a veto on this plan. The point of the backstop was to provide a legal guarantee to keep an open border under all circumstances. Being subject to approval every four years simply isn't the same thing. If Northern Ireland voted to leave this arrangement things like checks on food safety would have to take place at the Irish border.  What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

The prime minister told the Tory party conference that the SNP may try to put the Labour leader in power to deliver fresh votes on independence and Brexit.  Nicola Sturgeon has said she is ""open-minded"" about replacing Mr Johnson with a caretaker prime minister.  Mr Johnson said more referendums would cause ""total national discord"".  The prime minister was speaking on the final day of the Conservative Party conference in Manchester.  Opposition parties have been meeting to discuss the possibility of forcing him from office via a confidence motion, with the SNP pushing for an early vote.  However parties have so far failed to unite behind this plan, with Mr Corbyn saying such a vote should only take place ""at a point we can win it and take no-deal off the table"".  Mr Johnson used his speech to attack the Labour leader's suitability for office, but said ""the SNP may yet try to bundle him towards the throne"".  Mr Johnson said the SNP had a ""programme for total national discord"" which would see 2020 taken up by ""the chaos and cacophony of two more referendums - a second referendum on Scottish independence, even though the Scottish people were promised that the 2014 vote would be a once in a generation decision - and a second referendum on the EU"".  He said the UK was ""the most successful political partnership in history"", and said he would ""defend"" the union ""against those who would want only destroy it"".  Image copyright PA Media Image caption Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon differ over Brexit and independence  Ms Sturgeon wants to hold a new referendum on independence in the second half of 2020, and her government has put forward legislation at Holyrood to facilitate this.  However the first minister wants to secure an agreement with the UK government before holding such a vote, to put it ""beyond legal challenge"".  The UK government has so far refused to consider such a deal, saying the issue was settled with the 2014 referendum.  Ms Sturgeon calls this position ""unsustainable"" and ""undemocratic"", and has said Scotland's ""right to choose independence"" will be ""right at the heart"" of her party's platform in the expected general election.  New Brexit proposals  Mr Johnson's speech came as the government delivered its new Brexit proposals to the EU, including plans to replace the Irish backstop.  The prime minister told the conference that the only alternative to his plan was no-deal. The European Commission has said it will ""examine [the proposals] objectively"".  The plan, outlined in a seven-page document, would see Northern Ireland stay in the European single market for goods, but leave the customs union - resulting in new customs checks.  The Northern Ireland Assembly would get to approve the arrangements first and vote every four years on keeping them.  Government sources say they believe they could enter an intense 10-day period of negotiations with the EU almost immediately, with the aim of coming to a final agreement at an EU summit on 17 October.  SNP MP Stephen Gethins said Mr Johnson's proposal was ""utterly unacceptable and yet another push towards a catastrophic No-deal exit"".  He added: ""It is clear that if Johnson pursues crashing out of the EU without a deal - hitting jobs, public services and people's livelihoods - then the blame will lie solely and squarely at the door of the Tory party.""  Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - long-term critics of the backstop and partners of the Conservative Party in Parliament - gave a cautious welcome to the proposals.  But Sinn Fein said the plans were a ""non-starter"", and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the deal was ""not acceptable"" and ""worse"" than Theresa May's agreement, as it ""undermined"" the Good Friday Agreement that secured peace in Northern Ireland.",0
23,"Government denies that Brexit proposal titled ‘F*ck You, Eurotrash’ was designed to fail",23,"Boris Johnson EU deal Boris Johnson’s team have reacted furiously to a suggestion by Michel Barnier that the UK’s proposals were obviously designed to blame the EU for No Deal as it contained no workable solution to the Irish border question but over 400 insults directed at each European nation.  The EU claimed that having the foul-smelling document, delivered late by a sullen teenager and addressed to Frogface Barmier, was a calculated move to ensure rejection, and allow Boris Johnson to claim any No Deal fallout was the EU’s fault. Something categorically denied by Simon Williams MP, a junior minister for DexEU.  He explained, “We made our proposals in good faith and were never seeking to insult that assorted bunch of workshy wine drinkers that would all be German speakers if it weren’t for us.  “It is possible that there might have been a few cases of auto-corrected typos that changed perfectly sensible offers on cross-border veterinary certificates to words like Vespa riding whop or humourless kraut boxhead. But frankly, that is to be expected when things are done in urgency just as it is normal for legal documents to have a few faecal smears on them.”  Mr Williams also denied that Brexit policy was now only done with a view to capture the far-right vote and soothe ERG eurosceptics such as himself.  “If those unwashed eurocrats want to pretend to be offended then that’s nothing to do with us.  “As for me, I do not like the EU but I love Europe.

While some distillers claimed this would hurt them, the UK government explained that the selection of Scottish Whisky for this honour was a great portent of Britain’s future relationship with the USA.  As explained Simone Williams, advisor to Liz Truss and spokesperson for the Department of International Trade.  She went on, “All the careful relationships nurtured by Liz Truss and Boris Johnson, not to mention the sterling work done by Liam Fox, have been validated as we understand Donald Trump personally intervened to put Scotch Whisky on the list of goods he finds so amazing they should have a luxury price.  “Notice how the Irish distillers and French champagne makers are not even on the list.  “And if we leave without a deal, that exclusivity will apply in Europe and in places that have FTA’s with the EU like Japan. Imagine people worldwide looking at prohibitively expensive bottles of whisky and wondering what mighty nation produces such a desirable product.”  Government sources claim that the news of the tariffs, and the prospect of joining a global market free of the shackles of EU free trade, led many Scottish distillers to celebrate in the traditional Highland way of sobbing quietly for an hour before checking what the insurance payoff is for a factory fire.",1
11,Boris Johnson reveals his proposed Brexit deal to the European Union.,11," The plan, the key elements of which were leaked on Wednesday, would require new checks on the island of Ireland and between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the plan has numerous ""problematic points"" but that the EU would continue negotiations with the UK in the coming days.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the plan was ""worse than Theresa May's deal.""  Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.  LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson has submitted his proposal for a new Brexit deal to the European Union, as time runs out for the United Kingdom to agree a new Brexit deal.  In a letter to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday afternoon, Johnson insisted that he ""wants a deal"" but warned that there is ""very little time"" left to secure one before the October 31 deadline.  The plan, key elements of which were leaked to The Telegraph newspaper on Tuesday, is designed to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit.  However, Johnson has admitted that it will inevitably create some new checks on goods moving in and out of Northern Ireland, which under his proposal would take place away from the Irish border.  It received a warm welcome from the Democratic Unionist Party, which props up Johnson's minority government, but has been dismissed as ""not serious"" by senior Irish politicians and questioned by a number of experts.  The prime minister discussed the proposals over phone calls with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, on Wednesday.  Juncker said he welcomed Johnson's ""determination"" to reach a revised Brexit deal but that there were ""still some problematic points that will need further work in the coming days.""  A spokesperson for Juncker said: ""President Juncker confirmed to Prime Minister Johnson that the Commission will now examine the legal text objectively, and in light of our well-known criteria.  ""The EU wants a deal. We remain united and ready to work 24/7 to make this happen – as we have been for over three years now.""  What has Johnson offered the EU?  In the plan, sent to Juncker on Wednesday, there would be two new borders after Brexit: a customs border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, and a regulatory border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  Read more: An offer they will have to refuse: Boris Johnson is trying to force the EU into rejecting a Brexit deal  This is because the Northern Ireland would leave the customs union with the rest of the UK but continue to follow swathes of European single market rules covering agricultural and industrial goods.  This temporary arrangement would kick in at the end of the transition period in December 2020, should politicians in Northern Ireland's democratic institutions — its government and parliament — vote in favour of it.  Northern Ireland's politicians would then vote every four years whether to continue following those EU single market rules, or instead cut regulatory ties with Brussels and converge with the rest of the UK.  Northern Ireland has not had a functioning government or parliament since January 2017 when a row between the two largest parties — the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein — caused the institutions to collapse.  Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn the proposal was ""worse than Theresa May's deal.""  He added: ""I can't see it getting the support that he thinks it will get and it will take us into a regime in Britain of deregulation, of undercutting and I think will also undermine the Good Friday Agreement.""  The PM is accused of a sham negotiation  The EU is expected to reject the proposals when they arrive in Brussels.  Numerous experts have said they are unviable, with Peter Foster, the journalist who first revealed them, describing them as ""extraordinary"" and adding: ""I cannot for the life of me see how this flies; or could ever be intended to fly.""  The plan falls short of upholding the commitment made by the UK government when it was led by Theresa May, to make sure there are no physical checks on the island of Ireland whatsoever as a result of Brexit.  Jonathan Powell, who represented the UK government in Northern Ireland peace talks, saidthe proposals were ""not serious"" and indicated that Johnson was actually trying to avoid an agreement with the EU so no deal takes place.  And Helen McEntee, the Irish government's Minister for European Affairs, said the proposals were ""unacceptable"" as they breached the UK government's previous commitment to avoid physical checks on the island of Ireland.

Therefore, checks would be necessary on some trade, both between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and between Northern Ireland and mainland UK.  On the crucial issue of physical infrastructure to conduct customs checks, which Brussels has ruled unacceptable in any deal agreed, the UK government concede their proposals would require a small number at traders’ premises.  “...UK and EU customs regimes taking place electronically, and with the small number of physical checks needed conducted at traders’ premises or other points on the supply chain.”  The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the Tory administration's key Northern Irish allies in government, have given their approval to Johnson’s plans for a renegotiated Brexit deal. They insist that the proposals are “entirely consistent with the spirit” of the Good Friday Agreement, the 1998 Northern Irish peace deal, and safeguard the UK’s internal market.

21,‘Principled’ Brexiters promise to vote for deal they think is terrible as long as their boss promises to resign,21," Principled Brexiters Senior Brexit-backing MPs last night proved their love for Britain by promising to vote for a deal they think is bad for the country if it furthers their careers.  ERG members including Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg demonstrated their unshakable principles by offering to vote for something they have twice opposed as long as their boss resigns.  Johnson, who had already shown his suitability for leadership by having a natty haircut, made another impressive statement of his credentials by quoting the Bible in the Daily Telegraph – although he oddly missed out the bit about not committing adultery.  And Rees-Mogg proved he is a man of the people by giving one of his nannies a Sunday off and turning a crucial meeting on the future of the country into Bring Your Child to Work Day.  “These men are giants of modern politics and the future of government,” said an ERG insider after a group of hardline Brexiteers including Johnson and Rees-Mogg held meetings with the Prime Minister at Chequers.  “They are so committed to the good of the nation that they are prepared to cast their vote for the Prime Minister over a withdrawal agreement they have twice rejected as bad for Britain.  “Because really what is important for the country is that these posh blokes are in charge of whatever post-Brexit wasteland they help to create.  “It is what they were born to and what they are entitled to.”  Supporters of a softer Brexit expressed surprise at news of the meeting between the PM and a selection of Tory caricatures.  One senior campaigner said: “I only made a quick trip to the garden centre on Sunday so I would have loved a visit to Chequers.  “But maybe the PM has lost all the numbers from her phonebook apart from the ones marked ‘madmen’.  “That can be the only explanation for the meeting – either that or she’s more bothered about the party than the country”.",1
22,Disappointment that Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to prevent a no-deal Brexit doesn’t involve armed insurrection,22," Jeremy Corbyn Brexit Jeremy Corbyn has announced plans for a no-confidence vote followed by a temporary government to prevent a no-deal Brexit.  Whilst warmly received in some quarters, there was widespread disappointment that the plan appeared not to feature any sort of armed insurrection.  “Well, I’m pleased that Corbyn and the Labour Party have finally put forward a sensible suggestion that could help us out of this mess, but I must confess, I was hoping for a little more violence in the whole process,” explained Simon Williams, a normal British person who’s had to endure nearly ten years of ruinous Tory government.  “I mean, we’ve had austerity followed by Brexit followed by Boris Johnson, you can’t tell me that someone doesn’t deserve their head on a pike for all that.”  Mr Williams joined others in calling for Mr Corbyn to perhaps include a few days of violent uprising into his scheme.  He went on, “I’m not being greedy, maybe we could start out with some light rioting, then have the army refuse to get involved, then a dramatic march on Downing Street, a sacking of Number 10, and finally pop Boris’s head on a pike.  “After that, Corbyn can crack on with his no-confidence plan, which is great, but I just think it would be good if everyone could work off a little steam first.”  It is understood that Mr Corbyn is now considering introducing a few days of violent insurrection into his plan on the condition that no one smashes up his allotment greenhouse.",1
13,"Boris Johnson (right) and Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission. Getty",13," Boris Johnson will submit his ""final offer"" to the European Union on Wednesday.  The prime minister is set to publish details of his proposed Brexit deal after addressing Conservative party conference this afternoon.  Johnson has called for the backstop to be scrapped and replace with a new arrangement for managing the Irish border.  Details of Johnson's plan were revealed on Tuesday evening. They involve creating two borders and new checks on goods moving in and out of Northern Ireland.  A senior Irish minister said the reported plan was unacceptable.  Visit Business Insider's home page for more stories.  LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson will on Wednesday submit to the European Union his ""final offer"" on a Brexit deal as the United Kingdom approaches the October 31 cliff-edge.  Johnson will address Conservative party conference in Manchester, England before revealing the details of his proposal for managing the border between the Northern Ireland and Ireland after the UK has left the EU.  The question of how to preserve the status quo on the island of Ireland — primarily how to avoid checks and infrastructure on the border — has led to a stand-off between Johnson's UK government and the EU.  Under law passed last month, Johnson must secure parliamentary approval for a Brexit with deal with EU by mid-October, or request a fresh delay to the UK's exit through an extension to Article 50.  However, the prime minister has said he will not delay Brexit.  So what is Johnson's big offer?  The details of Johnson's offer to the EU were revealed by The Telegraph on Tuesday evening.  The prime minister on Tuesday described the offer as ""fair and reasonable.""  The key points of the prime minister's reported offer are that after the transition period, which would end in December 2020, the whole of the UK would leave the customs union, including Northern Ireland. However, Northern Ireland would continue to follow swathes of EU single market rules for at least another four years. After those four years end, its politicians would decide whether to either continue following EU rules, or converge with the rest of Great Britain.  In practice, this would mean:  Two new borders: a customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and a regulatory border in the Irish sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  A myriad of new checks on goods moving in and out of Northern Ireland.  This arrangement would be time-limited, creating a new cliff-edge in the mid-2020s.  Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, that props up the Conservative government in Westminster, would effectively have the power to veto continued alignment with the EU.  Numerous experts said the proposal was unviable, with Peter Foster, the journalist who revealed its details, describing it as ""extraordinary"" and adding: ""I cannot for the life of me see how this flies; or could ever be intended to fly.""  The proposal falls short of upholding the commitment made by the UK government when it was led by Theresa May, to make sure there are no physical checks on the island of Ireland whatsoever as a result of Brexit.  Jonathan Powell, who represented the UK government in Northern Ireland peace talks, said the proposals were ""not serious"" and indicated that Johnson was actually trying to avoid an agreement with the EU so no deal takes place.  And Helen McEntee, the Irish government's Minister for European Affairs, said the proposals were ""unacceptable"" as they breached the UK government's previous commitment to avoid physical checks on the island of Ireland.

The prime minister is expected to say: ""What people want, what Leavers want, what Remainers want, what the whole world wants — is to move on,"" he is expected to say.  ""I am afraid that after three-and-a-half years people are beginning to feel that they are being taken for fools.""  Pro-EU campaigners accused Johnson of looking for an ""excuse"" to deliver a no-deal Brexit.  ""Such a damaging idea isn't meant to create a breakthrough. By cutting away safeguards for the Good Friday Agreement, there's no doubt the government is looking for the EU to reject it,"" Naomi Smith, CEO of anti-Brexit group Best For Britain, told Business Insider.  ""This is not a sincere proposal. They want the EU to reject it so they have an excuse to force our country into a damaging no-deal Brexit, risking food and medicine shortages.""  ""These games only damage Britain's reputation on the world stage.""",0
7,"Giving the keynote speech to his Conservative party's annual conference in Manchester, England, the British Prime Minister told a packed conference hall that deal or no deal, the UK is ""coming out of the EU on October 31, come what may.""",7," So far, so predictable -- and the audience of party activists and lawmaker duly lapped it up. Johnson, after all, is the man who will ""get Brexit done.""  But his language on Britain's broader relationship with Europe was markedly softer. ""This is not an anti-European party and it is not an anti-European country. We love Europe,"" he sad. The response from the conference hall was decidedly muted. ""Well, I do, anyway,"" he muttered.  Whatever the reaction to Johnson in Manchester, it doesn't change the scale of the challenge he faces both in Westminster and Brussels.  Johnson later published a letter to the EU Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, setting out plans for a new Brexit deal, the existing one having been rejected three times in Parliament. Downing Street briefed before the speech that this would be a ""final"" offer to the EU. If Brussels doesn't like it, Johnson said in his speech that the UK is perfectly ready for no deal.  It's currently unclear if Brussels will engage with the plans. Johnson's letter is vague and, on first reading, still might breach some of the EU's red lines.  So, what is the Prime Minister up to?  The truth is that the PM is politically stuck. He wants to get a Brexit deal, but one that makes him look like he forced Brussels to back down. It needs it to be soft enough that opposition lawmakers will vote for it in the House of Commons, but firm enough that it's not seen as a sellout by his own hardline Brexiteers.  He also needs to signal to voters that he has done everything in his power to drag Brexit over the line, while demonstrating to Brexit moderates that he hasn't been irresponsible.  All of which explains why Johnson simultaneously professes that no-deal is ""not an outcome we seek at all,"" yet ""it is an outcome for which we are ready,"" accompanied by a plan that is unacceptable to the EU.

MUST WATCH Boris Johnson tells opponents to hold no-confidence vote 02:41  The PM trying to speak out of both sides of his mouth because he thinks an election is coming. And that election might come after he is forced to request an extension to the Article 50 process and delay Brexit.  While Johnson would much prefer an election after Brexit is done, it might not be up to him. Legislation has been passed by Johnson's opponents in Parliament to demand that he requests an extension, should no deal be agreed between the UK and the EU. Should he choose to ignore that law, he could be faced with legal problems that are unprecedented for a sitting Prime Minister -- even one who was recently slapped down by the UK Supreme Court.  Yet, despite Johnson saying he would rather be ""dead in a ditch"" than delay Brexit, it might not be so bad to be dragged kicking and screaming across that ditch by meddlesome judges. It would give Johnson an easy election campaign in which he could present himself as the only major party leader that wants to deliver Brexit. If he gets a majority, it's a done deal.  We will soon find out the precise details of the Johnson Brexit plan and whether it really is a final offer or a shock tactic designed to force the EU into further talks.  ""Unless the proposals are a starting point, it's very hard to see both sides going into a tunnel to try and finalize a deal,"" says Mujtaba Rahman, managing director of the Eurasia Group think tank. ""If this is indeed the final offer, it's very hard to see a landing zone between the two sides.""  If the EU is not willing to negotiate, Johnson will be pressurized hard to request that Brexit extension. Johnson can then march around the UK and legitimately claim to be the only political big beast committed to getting Brexit done. And as he does so, he will alienate moderate voters.  If the EU does negotiate, Johnson's opponents on the right will be able to legitimately claim that Johnson keeling to Brussels, and he will lose voters to Nigel Farage's Brexit Party.  On the whole, Boris Johnson can judge his first party conference as Prime Minister to have been a success. But it also marked a new phase in the Johnson premiership, as he tries to appeal to moderates, Brexiteers, Conservatives and liberal internationalists alike.  The problem for Johnson is that doing so might be impossible. Eventually, he will need to pick a side.  In his speech, the Prime Minister spoke about his love of buses. Sooner or later, he'll have to throw someone under one.",0
8,Boris Johnson is preparing to make his final Brexit offer to the European Union.,8," However, a leaked version of the offer suggests that it will be almost immediately rejected by Brussels.  The key elements of the proposed deal appear to be impossible for the EU and Ireland to accept.  This suggests Johnson is deliberately setting up his offer to be rejected.  Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.  Boris Johnson will on Wednesday make his formal offer to the European Union for a new Brexit deal.  The offer, the key elements of which have been leaked to the Daily Telegraph's Peter Foster, is quite remarkable in that it appears to actually be designed for the EU to reject it.  In summary Johnson's offer is that:  Northern Ireland temporarily remains aligned to EU trade rules for some agricultural and industrial goods.  But Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK leaves the customs union.  New checks will be imposed at two borders (between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and along the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.)  Northern Ireland will be exempt from EU VAT rules and custom codes.  After four years Northern Ireland will have the option of cutting off alignment with the EU.  Every element of the plan runs against the EU's negotiating red lines.  From the very start of this process, Brussels and Dublin have insisted that there must be no new border checks with Northern Ireland. This is a commitment that the UK government signed up when led by Theresa May.  The EU has also been clear that the integrity of the European Single Market must be maintained and that there must be no get-out clauses for the UK a few years down the line.  All of those red lines are broken by this offer.  According to the Telegraph report, Johnson's chief of staff Dominic Cummings told senior aides that ""if they reject our offer, that's it.""  Yet Cummings and Johnson must know that this will be rejected. Indeed it is hard to come to any conclusion other than that rejection is precisely what these proposals are designed to achieve.  An offer the EU will have to refuse  The Godfather Getty  Johnson was asked earlier this year by the Daily Mail what his favourite movie scene was and he replied that it was ""the multiple retribution killings at the end of 'The Godfather'.""  However, there was another scene from the film which better explains the situation Johnson has engineered.  Early in the movie, Michael Corleone explains how his father Vito once persuaded a bandleader to hire his godson by telling him that ""either his brains or his signature would be on the contract.""  Johnson's offer today appears to have the complete opposite intent. Rather than being an ""offer they can't refuse,"" this is an offer the EU will have no choice but to refuse.  So what is the UK playing at and where will this end up? There are two distinct possibilities.  1. Bouncing the EU into a no-deal Brexit  Boris Johnson and Jean-Claude Juncker Getty Johnson's government has a majority of minus 43 in the UK parliament. Even if by some miracle, the EU was to agree to these proposals, he has zero chance of getting it passed by members of Parliament.  That would appear to suggest that the UK is inevitably heading for a no-deal scenario on October 31.  However, earlier this month MPs passed a new law which would compel Johnson to request a fresh Brexit delay if no deal has been secured by October 19.  This would be a nightmare scenario for the prime minister given his repeated insistence that there is ""no circumstances"" under which he would allow Brexit to be delayed.  But Downing Street understands that while the so-called Benn act will compel them to request a new extension to Article 50, it does not compel EU leaders to accept one.  By making such an unreasonable offer to the EU, Johnson could be hoping to bounce Brussels into rejecting any further delay. After all, what is the point for the EU of delaying Brexit for a third time when the UK government appears totally unwilling to agree to any of their demands for a deal after another delay?  So is this what Downing Street is attempting? It may be, but there is another possibility.  2. Setting up the EU to take the blame for a Brexit delay  Conservative Party Conference in Manchester Getty Whatever the claims from Johnson that he is determined to leave the EU on October 31 ""do or die,"" his government has not made enough serious preparation for the UK to leave the EU without a deal at the end of October. Anyone who has travelled through Britain's ports in recent weeks will have looked in vain for the massive new infrastructure required to cope with the new checks required for a no-deal scenario. And while many businesses are stockpiling for the possibility of their supplies being held up at ports, as Business Insider revealed earlier this year, there is nowhere near the sort of warehousing space required to seriously prepare for a no-deal exit and no time at all to create it.  Read more: No-deal Brexit stockpiling panic as British businesses warn warehouses are already booked up for Christmas  That means that a no-deal Brexit would be a disastrous outcome, not just for the UK economy, but for the government which chose to put the country through it. For this reason it remains difficult to believe that this is seriously the outcome that either Johnson, or the EU, will ultimately go for.  Whatever the briefings to the contrary, another Brexit delay therefore remains the most likely outcome at the end of October, which means that the main priority for Downing Street now is to prepare the ground for who will get the blame for it.  In the past week, Johnson's team has spent a lot of effort seeking to push most of that blame onto the UK parliament, with friendly newspapers briefed with the suggestion that British MPs are engaged in ""foreign collusion"" with the EU in order to frustrate Brexit.  Taken in that context, today's offer appears to have a similar design. By offering something that will be impossible for the EU to accept, the UK can then blame the EU for rejecting it, while avoiding getting dragged into lengthy negotiations which in themselves would require an agreement to delay Brexit.  Of course none of this amounts to a real attempt to, in the words of the Conservative Party's conference slogan this week, ""get Brexit done."" At best it is yet another attempt to put off the difficult choices that Brexit requires and at worst it is a reckless strategy that risks a disastrous outcome for the UK economy.",0
14,LONDON — Boris Johnson was accused of lying to the queen when he illegally suspended Parliament last month.,14," But that hasn’t scared him off coming back for a second shot.  This time, though, Parliament will be suspended for a much shorter period, ending its current session on the evening of Tuesday, Oct. 8, before resuming the following Monday.  The government says the move is necessary to deliver the Queen’s Speech — the traditional procedure marking the beginning of a new session of Parliament, in which the queen outlines the government’s legislative agenda for the new session.  Johnson, who became prime minister in July, was handed a humiliating smackdown by the country’s Supreme Court last month when it ruled his attempt to suspend Parliament for an extraordinary five weeks — taking it out of action for a critical period ahead of Britain’s scheduled departure from the EU on Oct. 31 — was politically motivated and unlawful. Parliament was then swiftly reinstated, but according to parliamentary procedures, the current session still needs to be brought to an end.  Johnson said at the time he would abide by the ruling, even though he strongly disagreed with it. The ruling prompted widespread calls for Johnson to resign for misleading the queen.  Read: Boris Johnson Must Know the EU Will Never Accept His Latest Brexit Pitch  In a statement, Downing Street said the suspension would be “for the shortest time possible” to allow the government to prepare for the state opening of Parliament.  Johnson said the Queen’s Speech would outline the government’s plans for domestic issues: the national health service, education, crime, and the economy.  “We will get Brexit done on Oct. 31 and continue delivering on these vital issues.”  The announcement came just hours after Britain delivered its final pitch to the EU for a last-minute Brexit deal. Johnson has said he hopes to secure a deal with EU leaders at a critical summit starting Oct. 17, but insists Britain will leave the bloc at the end of the month whether it has an agreement or not.

32,"“Me, me, me, me, me”: Boris Johnson clarifies position on Brexit",32," Boris on being prime minister Boris Johnson today clarified his stance on Brexit by insisting: “Me, me, me, me, me.”  The floppy-haired Conservative jester has told friends his principles on Europe will remain intrinsically linked to his chances of becoming Prime Minister.  And he said he remains confident rank-and-file Tories will continue to lap up his ‘loveable cad’ schtick, providing he impresses them with liberal use of Latin and references to Greek mythology.  “Boris’s beliefs have been consistent throughout his career,” said one aide close to the former foreign secretary.  “He believes, above all else, in his own destiny to become Prime Minister.”  Friends of Mr Johnson are now preparing for an inevitable leadership campaign and are understood to be considering the slogan ‘Vote for me, plebs, you know you want to’.  One member of the early-planning team said: “Boris wants a slogan that captures the essential truth that Tories in the shires will vote for him however scheming and self-serving he is shown to be.  “Other possibilities being considered include ‘Come On Ladies, Vote for Big Boris’ and ‘Vote Boris for Brilliant Jokes’.  “He hasn’t really thought beyond a snappy slogan so far and, to be honest, he probably won’t bother.  “Let’s be honest, he’s spent the last three years not bothering with any of the facts or details of Brexit, and lots of people still think he has all the answers.”  When asked by reporters outside his home for his reaction to Theresa May’s promise to resign, Johnson said: “Me, me, me, me, me.”",1
29,"Lightweight, artificial object that’s bad for the environment has disposable coffee cup snatched away from it",29," Boris Johnson has coffee cup taken away from him A phoney substance that is only known for one thing and has proven to be bad for whatever environment it is left in has had a disposable coffee cup snatched away from its hands, it has emerged.  The incident, which was caught on camera behind the scenes at the Conservative Party Conference earlier today, saw an aide snatch a foam coffee cup from disposable basic Prime Minister, Boris Johnson.  “It’s unsustainable, bad for the environment, and with a lasting negative effect on society,” explained aide Karen Williams, “and that’s why it shouldn’t be allowed to drink any more coffee.  “It’s bad enough as it is, lumbering around causing chaos and sullying everything it touches, without having caffeine inside it making it ten times worse for everyone.”  Wringing her hands, she went on, “You thought your job was hard? I’ve got to make it seem like the Tory party care about the environment, but it’s a tough ask when we’ve got someone like Boris on the scene.  “He is a single-use Prime Minister who was brought in to get Brexit delivered and then to be discarded, but he can’t even get that right.  “At this rate we’re going to have to recycle Theresa May’s deal just to make it look like we’re trying.”",1
9,"With his bombastic battle-cry of 'Get Brexit Done', Boris Johnson left the conference stage to ecstatic applause.",9," His first speech as PM was everything they were hoping for: impassioned, optimistic and funny.  On Brexit he was typically bullish about leaving on time, and rattled through plans that he promised would build a 'positive new partnership' with the EU.  With his bombastic battle-cry of 'Get Brexit Done', Boris Johnson left the Conservative Party Conference stage to ecstatic applause at the Manchester Convention Centre  No longer can critics accuse him of not trying to get a deal; he has presented a serious proposal and thrown down the gauntlet to Brussels.  The stakes could hardly be higher on both sides. The blamegame has truly begun.  Boris's blueprint is radically different from anything Theresa May even considered, and arises from a combination of principle and political necessity.  Johnson has long argued that Mrs May's deal would have made trade deals impossible. He wants us to be free to go our own way after Brexit.  The logical consequence of that position is there must be a customs border between Northern Ireland and the south.  But there will be no border checks – which would inflame nationalist sentiment.  The Prime Minister (pictured with Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid) was typically bullish about Brexit and rattled through plans that he promised would build a 'positive new partnership' with the EU  For example, an Australian tractor would face checks as it crossed from Liverpool to Belfast to make sure it met product standards.  If it was then moved across the border to Dublin, it would be tracked and would face customs checks where it left and where it arrived.  But what about regulatory checks, which Brussels insists are needed on goods entering the EU?  On this, Mr Johnson – and his allies in the DUP – have offered a significant compromise which would see Northern Ireland follow EU rules.  He has taken the two border challenges – customs and regulations – and split them between the two sides.  Call it a fudge if you like, it is a workable attempt to solve an intractable problem.  Boris's blueprint is radically different from anything Theresa May even considered, and arises from a combination of principle and political necessity (pictured with girlfriend Carrie Symonds)  To sweeten the bitter pill of having laws for Northern Ireland set by Brussels, the Northern Ireland Assembly and executive must sign off the plan now and every four years.  With some considerable force in his letter Mr Johnson said these votes were 'fundamental to democracy'.  As soon as the proposals were published, all eyes were on Arlene Foster of the DUP.  Would her party declare 'no surrender' and kill it off? No. Standing shoulder to shoulder with Mr Johnson at a raucous Tory conference rally on Tuesday night, it was clear they were fully inside the tent.  In theory, these developments could unlock a narrow majority in Parliament.  Many of the 21 Tory MPs who were stripped of the whip will still vote for a deal. With the DUP onside, that's ten more.  And if the DUP don't object, most of the European Research Group will back the deal, as could more than a dozen Labour MPs.  So what is Brussels' next move?  If Brussels were to dismiss the deal or place impossible obstacles in its path it would be a sign they are listening to Remainers such as Tony Blair and Dominic Grieve, who say there should be a second referendum with an option to stay.  For some – though not all – EU leaders, this would be a preferred outcome.  On the other hand, perhaps Emmanuel Macron will seize a chance to kick Britain out as quickly as possible? Will Angela Merkel be as uncompromising as when she stifled David Cameron's renegotiation? Will Varadkar realise he is in a hole, facing a No Deal disaster?  Surprisingly, it is Cognacswilling commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in whom senior ministers are investing hope. Shortly to retire, doing a Brexit deal would be a lasting legacy.  Turning the deal down would surely be a tactical error.  There is a slim possibility of Remainer MPs getting their acts together enough to force a second referendum, and it would string things out for months if not years.  Much more likely is that the courts force the UK to follow the terms of the so-called 'Surrender Act' – which prevents a No Deal Brexit – and delay our leaving the EU, prompting a general election.  If the polls are right, Mr Johnson could triumph, and with a Commons majority he would be in a much stronger position.  The threat was clear in Mr Johnson's conference speech: 'Let us be in no doubt that the alternative is No Deal.'  Last night, No 10 officials said that if the answer is a flat 'No', Mr Johnson won't even attend the summit in two weeks' time when the deal would be signed off. So EU leaders have a choice.  They can engage, be pragmatic and try to find a solution.  Or they can turn over the negotiating table and walk away before Boris Johnson has even sat down.",0
18,Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption The purported UK plan involves cross-border customs checks and a regulatory border in the Irish Sea,18," Sources within the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) have told the BBC they are pleased with Boris Johnson's new Brexit proposal to replace the Irish backstop.  The Daily Telegraph earlier claimed the plan involves ""two borders"" until 2025.  It reported an Irish Sea ""regulatory border"" and customs checks between the Republic and Northern Ireland.  Addressing his party conference on Wednesday, the PM ruled out ""checks at or near the border"".  He also said the proposal would ""protect the existing regulatory arrangements"".  The unconfirmed newspaper report in the Daily Telegraph also said the proposed four-year time limit would give the Northern Ireland Assembly a vote in 2025 on whether or not to extend the arrangement.  In his speech to the Conservative Party conference, Mr Johnson described his plan as a ""compromise for both sides"" which would ""protect the union"".  ""We will under no circumstances have checks at or near the border in Northern Ireland,"" the prime minister said.  ""And by a process of renewable democratic consent by the executive and assembly of Northern Ireland we will go further and protect the existing regulatory arrangements for farmers and other businesses on both sides of the border.  ""And at the same time we will allow the UK - whole and entire - to withdraw from the EU, with control of our own trade policy from the start.""  'Unionist veto'  Before the conference, BBC News NI's political editor, Mark Devenport, sought reaction to the newspaper claims of the UK's purported ""final offer"" to the European Union.  ""DUP sources appear happy and content with the proposal because they say the backstop was anti-democratic; gave Northern Ireland no say,"" said our political editor.  ""But under the Boris Johnson offer, the Northern Ireland Assembly could choose to stay with this EU regulation, or move towards [regulatory alignment with] Great Britain in 2025.  ""And the way that voting would operate in the Northern Ireland Assembly is that unionists, if they didn't like the road that Northern Ireland was going down, would be able to veto that and move towards Great Britain.""  However, the Irish government has consistently rejected previous proposals that have involved customs checks on the island of Ireland or a time-limited backstop.  'All speculation'  When unconfirmed reports of the UK's proposals emerged late on Tuesday night, Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney said he had not seen the details but he, again, rejected the idea of a time limit.  ""So the rumour mill this evening is suggesting that there would be a four-year time limit and then a choice to be made by Northern Ireland at the end of that period, but again that's all speculation,"" Mr Coveney told Virgin Media's The Tonight Show on Tuesday.  ""Our position has been very clear on a time-limited backstop. If it's time-limited, and you can't answer the question what happens at the end of that time period, then it's not a backstop at all.""  Mr Coveney added that if the reports were true, then ""it doesn't look like it's the basis for an agreement, that's for sure"".  The Daily Telegraph reported that the UK plan ""effectively means that Northern Ireland will remain in large parts of the EU single market until at least 2025 - but will leave the EU customs union alongside the rest of the UK"".  The paper added that the proposals are likely to face ""fierce opposition from EU leaders who will be asked to grant the UK sweeping exemptions from EU customs rules to facilitate a Northern Irish customs border"".  'Strangle economy'  The leader of Northern Ireland's Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) Colum Eastwood said Mr Johnson's reported offer to the EU ""doubles down on his hard border plan"".  ""A regulatory border in the Irish Sea and a customs border across this island will strangle the local economy and runs contrary to the interests of communities and businesses here.""  On the basis of the report, Mr Eastwood has called on the leaders of the UK's biggest parties to vote Mr Johnson out of office.  ""I have written to the leaders of the Labour Party, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats at Westminster today asking them to take part in an unprecedented act of political selflessness to stop this chaos and protect the fragile interests of Northern Ireland,"" the SDLP leader said.  ""They must come together, pass a motion of no confidence in Johnson and unite behind a common candidate as a temporary measure to extend the Article 50 period.""  Alliance leader and MEP Naomi Long said: ""This proposal is in many ways the worst of both worlds, as we've gone from having no new borders to having two.  ""There is no respect for the particular complexities of Northern Ireland, our interdependent economy and society, and the Good Friday Agreement.""",0
34,Jeremy Corbyn responds to renewed threat of no-deal Brexit with marathon jam-making session,34," Jeremy Corbyn allotment Jeremy Corbyn has responded to Boris Johnson’s threat to take Britain out of the EU without a deal with a commitment to finish making three dozen jars of strawberry jam by this weekend.  The jam, which Corbyn described as a central plank of his policies, is currently setting in jars on his counter-top – meaning the Labour Leader is tragically unavailable to table a no-confidence motion in the new Prime Minister.  Corbyn is understood to be ‘fully committed’ to taking the jam out of the large stewing pot on his hob, and dismissed suggestions that he might find more constructive things to do with his time.  “As part of his firm pledge to listen to both party members and the people of Britain about the things which matter to them most, Jeremy has announced a wide-ranging consultation into whether they prefer pickle or chutney with their sandwiches,” a Labour spokesman told us.  “This follows his hard-hitting campaign earlier this year to ensure those little paper circles you put on the top of the jar are made from recycled materials.  “Voters can rest safe in the knowledge that the party leader will spend the summer recess fighting for them and their rights from the comfort and safety of his shed, when he’s not busy making some of his trademark preserves.”  The spokesman went on to describe any suggestion that Corbyn is an utterly hopeless waste of space as ‘smears from Conserve-atives’.",1

The ‘war game scenario’ developed by the DfT saw 87 trucks meet at a disused airport before starting their journey to Dover, where they were directed en-masse to drive straight over the White Cliffs.  The wreckage of dozens of smouldering trucks has been declared ‘par for the course’, and a good omen for the weeks ahead as the parliamentary Brexit vote is scheduled for next week.  A DfT spokesperson confirmed, “The test went as well as can be expected, given this is something only morons are in favour of.  “The trucks caused no real tailbacks to other road users, and they were able to drive straight off the cliff smoothly and without delay.”  Brexit supporter Simon Williams welcomed the trial run, insisting that British lorries can throw themselves off a cliff as well as any European counterpart.  He went on, “The only thing wrong with the exercise was that there was nothing written on the side of the trucks about how great Brexit is going to be.”  Those who have voiced concerns over the capacity of the disused Airport found they were also quickly dismissed by the DfT.  The spokesperson continued, “We’ve heard people suggest that Manston Airfield can only hold 6,000 vehicles, nowhere near the number expected to drive over the cliff in the event of a no-deal.  “We can, however, confirm that we have contingency plans to use both Gatwick and Heathrow which we assume will no longer be needed either.”",1
28,"Government proposes Schrodingers Irish Border, which exists when you want sovereignty and doesn’t exist when you want frictionless trade",28," Boris and Schrodingers Irish Border The Irish border will exist in multiple uncertain states in which it both exists and doesn’t exist at the same time depending on what you want right this second, according to proposals unveiled today.  Two borders will coexist in a state of quantum superposition; one which prevents undesirables and European laws from crossing, and another which is highly permeable to cheap imports.  Despite seeming internally contradictory, the Department for Exiting the EU insist that quantum events have been observed at the Planck scale and can exist for a fraction of a second, so permanently applying it to the Irish border is no more ridiculous than anything else they’ve suggested.  The government expects the suggestion to be warmly received by the European Union, which similarly exists in two states at once depending on who is speaking; one where it is so weak it desperately needs British money and another where it is powerful enough to bully Britain.  “The border would exist in a theoretical state which is only resolved when you look at it,” a spokesman told us. “So if you’re driving a lorry load of car parts, for example, the border exists as a wave, as we wave you through.  “But if you’re a migrant fruit picker hoping to take a cash-in-hand job it resolves as a particle which has enough volume, density and mass as is required to stop you passing. Simple!  “Also, at high energy states, the Irish border can jump to a higher shell at Drogheda, whilst at lower energies it will manifest in the Irish sea.”  “What do Michael Gove and an electron have in common?” he added.  “They both interfere with themselves when nobody is looking.”",1

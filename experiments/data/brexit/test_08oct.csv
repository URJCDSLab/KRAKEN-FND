13,"Britain and the European Union traded ill-tempered barbs Tuesday as the U.K. said a Brexit deal might be impossible, while insisting it was still working for one with just over three weeks until its scheduled departure from the bloc.",13," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office said EU intransigence had led to a breakdown in negotiations, prompting a top European leader to warn against playing a ""stupid blame game"" — and chide Johnson in Latin.  Johnson's office gave a gloomy assessment after his call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday morning.  In a statement to British media, Downing Street said Merkel had told Johnson that ""a deal is overwhelmingly unlikely"" unless the U.K. agreed to let Northern Ireland continue to follow EU customs rules in order to maintain an open border with EU member Ireland.  That is something the British government says it can't accept. Downing Street said that ""if this represents a new established position, then it means a deal is essentially impossible not just now but ever."" How people and goods will move across the Irish border is the main sticking point to a deal.  The German government confirmed that Merkel and Johnson had spoken but declined to comment on the substance of ""confidential conversations.""  European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said ""the EU position has not changed. We want a deal. We are working for a deal with the U.K.""  European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted testily that ""what's at stake is not winning some stupid blame game.""  ""At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people,"" he said, addressing Johnson. ""You don't want a deal, you don't want an extension, you don't want to revoke, quo vadis?"" — a Latin phrase meaning ""where are you going?""  Despite the grim mood music, British officials insisted they still hope to strike a deal before Britain's scheduled Oct. 31 departure date — although Johnson has also said the U.K. will leave even if one is not struck.  ""We've moved — it is now time for the EU to move too,"" said Michael Gove, the minister in charge of Brexit preparations. ""If it does, then there is still every chance we can leave with a new deal.""  Downing Street said Johnson spoke by phone to Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar on Tuesday afternoon, and ""both sides strongly reiterated their desire to reach a Brexit deal."" It said the two leaders hoped to meet in person later in the week.  EU leaders have demanded more ""realism"" from Britain in response to a Brexit plan proposed by Johnson. The bloc says the proposals — which would require customs checks on some goods moving between Northern Ireland and Ireland — don't fulfill the U.K.'s commitment to a frictionless Irish border.  An open border is key to both the regional economy and the peace agreement that ended 30 years of conflict between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland is part of the U.K. but shares an island — and a land border — with the Republic of Ireland.  ""It's not just about trade, it's about so much more than that, and anybody who understands Ireland and the politics of this island understands that,"" said Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney.  French President Emmanuel Macron has said the EU will assess by Friday whether a deal is possible.  Johnson's opponents in Britain accused the government of deliberately undermining the Brexit talks.  ""Boris Johnson will never take responsibility for his own failure to put forward a credible deal. His strategy from day one has been for a no-deal Brexit,"" said Keir Starmer, Brexit spokesman for the main opposition Labour Party.  On Tuesday, Britain published more details of its plans for leaving without a divorce deal. The government says those plans will minimize any resulting economic shock.  Economists and business groups warn that no amount of preparation can eliminate the pain of new barriers with the EU, which accounts for almost half of U.K. trade.  The government's ""no-deal readiness report"" shows significant British preparation but also acknowledges its limits. Britain says it will try to keep goods flowing by not immediately imposing border checks on imports from the EU. But the government acknowledges there will be new tariffs on 60% of British exports to the EU, including levies of more than 50% on beef and lamb.  Many in the EU — and in Britain — are skeptical that Britain will leave the bloc on Oct. 31 because the U.K. Parliament has passed a law compelling the government to ask the EU for a delay to Brexit if no deal is agreed upon by Oct. 19.  Johnson says he will obey the law but will not ask for a delay. It's not clear how those two statements can be reconciled — but it's clear Johnson wants to pin the blame for any delay on Parliament and the EU, so that he can campaign as a champion of Brexit in an election that's likely to be called soon.  Both the government and the opposition see a national vote as the only way to break Britain's Brexit deadlock, though they disagree on the timing.  Parliament is set to be suspended Tuesday evening so that a new session can begin next week with a major policy speech from Johnson's Conservative government.  An earlier attempt by the government to shut down Parliament for five weeks was ruled illegal by Britain's Supreme Court because it had the effect of preventing legislators from scrutinizing the government's Brexit plans. This week's shorter suspension is more routine. Lawmakers will return on Monday.  ———  Casert reported from Brussels.

11,London (CNN Business) The chances of Britain leaving the European Union with a deal on October 31 are fading fast. That's likely to leave the country facing a general election which could lead to a 'no deal' Brexit or a new coalition government led by leftwinger Jeremy Corbyn that would give voters the chance to remain in the European Union.,11," Business hates the chaos that would accompany the first of those two scenarios . It would prefer Britain to remain in the European Union but has deep misgivings about Corbyn's tax and nationalization agenda . A new report published Tuesday by the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), an economic research institute, in association with Citigroup, examines the economic consequences of both potential outcomes.  The first scenario, where Britain crashes out of the European Union without a deal that protects trade, would wipe out two years of economic growth, according to the IFS. Prime Minister Boris Johnson insists he wants to follow this path if a deal cannot be secured before the October 31 deadline.  Tensions between Johnson and EU officials are rising, leading to an exchange of views on Tuesday that suggests a deal is out of reach.  ""What's at stake is not winning some stupid blame game. At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people. You don't want a deal, you don't want an extension, you don't want to revoke, quo vadis?"" European Council President Donald Tusk said in a tweet directed at Johnson.  ""Talks in Brussels are close to breaking down,"" a UK government source also said.  The most likely scenario now is that Brexit is delayed yet again, an outcome that Britain's parliament has sought to ensure by passing a law requiring Johnson to seek an extension if he can't get a deal with EU officials.  Opposition parties will then try to force an election in November. If Johnson wins, a no-deal exit is back on. The most likely alternative is a coalition government led by Corbyn's Labour Party. The IFS report analyzes a scenario where the government holds a second referendum and Brexit is revoked.  No deal, no growth  The UK economy would not grow at all in 2020 and 2021 in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the IFS report finds.  The European Union is the United Kingdom's single biggest trading partner, accounting for 44% of total UK exports of goods and services in 2017, according to the IFS. UK government research published Tuesday said that businesses would face £7.5 billion ($9.2 billion) in additional administrative costs relating to trade each year in the event of a no-deal exit.  Debt is projected to rise substantially in that scenario, climbing to almost 90% of annual economic output for the first time since the mid-1960s, as the government borrows more to increase spending and kickstart economic growth.  But weaker household consumption and declining investment growth would offset the increase in government spending, according to the IFS. Interest rate cuts to zero and quantitative easing worth £50 billion ($61 billion) would not provide enough relief, as declining trade also proves a drag on growth.  The economy would expand by just 1.1% in 2022 and the government would be forced to revert to austerity in order to keep debt under control. Over the longer term, the United Kingdom's economic trajectory post Brexit would depend on government policy relating to tariffs, regulation and immigration.  Stopping Brexit is best for UK economy  The IFS does not mince words about which scenario would be best for the UK economy: ""Revoking Brexit would lead to the best economic outcome,"" its report says.  The institute suggests that Brexit could be called off if a coalition of parties led by Labour triumph in a general election. They might hold a second referendum on Brexit, and the public could return a vote against leaving the European Union.  Calling off Brexit would boost private consumption, which accounts for two thirds of the UK economy. That would, in turn, cause economic growth to accelerate.  Crucially, this scenario assumes that smaller parties such as the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party would form a government with Labour, and limit the party's ability to implement some of its more radical policies.  If fully implemented, Labour's economic proposals — including widespread nationalizations and handing 10% of large companies' share capital to employees — would ""likely do significant damage to the outlook for UK growth,"" says the IFS.  That's because higher taxes and changes to labor laws favored by Corbyn would make the United Kingdom less attractive to foreign investors and could trigger outflows of domestic capital.  The damage done  The UK economy is already 2.5% smaller than it would have been had voters chosen three years ago to remain in the European Union, according to Citi's chief UK economist, Christian Schulz.  Even if Brexit were called off, the flatlining of business investment in the United Kingdom over the past three years would be difficult to unwind, Schulz said at a media briefing on Tuesday.  ""This will stick with the UK economy for a long time,"" he said.",0
29,DUP demand Theresa May perform Cersei Lannister-style ‘walk of shame’ in return for Brexit support,29," DUP Brexit support for Theresa May Noted sane and reasonable political party the DUP have confirmed that Theresa May resigning will not be enough to convince them to support her deal.  Instead, they have demanded that the Prime Minister perform a Cersei Lannister style Walk of Shame.  This would see Mrs May walk naked through the streets of London whilst Arlene Foster walk ahead of her ringing a bell and shouting ‘shame, shame’.  As Theresa May currently has no dignity left whatsoever, she has simply elected to comply with the demand.  “The Prime Minster’s Walk of Shame will take place next Tuesday at 10am,” explained Mrs Foster, foaming a little at the mouth.  “She will spend an hour walking through Westminster in shame and penance for defying the DUP.  “I hope that after having done so, she will understand who really runs things now and that we will not be bought off with something as simple as a resignation and a billion pounds.”  As is tradition, the public will be able to line the route of the Walk of Shame and throw vegetables at the shamed.  The public is advised to get there very early as it is expected that every man, woman and child in Britain will be looking to take part, so there will be crowds.",1
7,Boris Johnson risks a backlash from Brexit supporters if he delays the UK's departure from the EU beyond October.,7," Nearly two-thirds of Leave voters say Johnson would share the blame if the UK is forced to seek a Brexit later this month, which appears inevitable.  The poll indicates Downing Street's fears that a delay could damage the Conservative Party's standing in the polls ahead of a possible general election later this year.  However, an even greater proportion (83%) of the public would blame Members of Parliament as a whole if Brexit does not take place in October.  LONDON — Boris Johnson risks a major backlash from voters at the next election if he delays Brexit according to new polling which finds that nearly two-thirds of Leave voters and three-quarters of Conservative voters believe the prime minister will share the blame if the UK is forced to seek an Article 50 extension.  The ComRes study for the Daily Telegraph found that just over half (56%) of voters would hold the Prime Minister responsible if Brexit does not take place by the October 31 deadline.  That figure rises nearly two-thirds (64%) among 2016 Leave voters, and three-quarters (75%) among Conservative voters.  The figures are significant because they illustrate why Downing Street is so keen to avoid seeking a delay, which Johnson could be forced to do in less than two weeks.  The Conservative Party is currently polling on 32%, with the Lib Dems trailing on 23%, Labour on 21%, and the Brexit Party on 12%, according to the latest YouGov poll.  That lead could be enough to win the party a slim majority if there is an election later this year, but the government fears it could lose support to the Brexit Party if it fails to deliver on its central pledge to leave the EU by October 31.  Johnson will likely be forced to break his ""do-or-die"" pledge to leave the EU by Halloween because MPs last month passed a law which orders him to request an Article 50 extension to delay Brexit if he cannot agree a Brexit deal by October.  That paves the way for an election later this year, most likely in November, after Labour rejected one in September until Article 50 had been delayed.  The survey suggests that Johnson's strategy of seeking to preemptively blame his opponents for any delay may still work, however.  The ComRes poll found that an even greater proportion (83%) of the public would blame parliament if Brexit does not take place in October.  Seven in ten said they would blame Remain-supporting MPs specifically, while nearly two-thirds (63%) said the European Commission would share some of the blame.  ComRes polled 2,006 British adults between October 4 and 6 for its survey.  A 'very fair, generous and reasonable offer'  The EU has indicated that it will reject Johnson's proposals, tabled last week, to remove the Irish backstop from the current deal, meaning the chances of a deal by next weekend's EU summit are vanishingly small.  Boris Johnson on Monday night urged Brussels to consider his ""very fair, generous and reasonable offer.""  ""We haven't really heard the detail from them about what they think the problems are,"" he said.  ""It's time for us to get together and really thrash this thing out.""  But a Downing Street source, widely believed to be Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings, told the Spectator magazine that talks will ""probably end this week.""  The source predicted that MPs who passed the extension law, called the Benn Act, were responsible for torpedoing negotiations.  ""Those who pushed the Benn Act intended to sabotage a deal and they've probably succeeded,"" they said.  ""So the main effect of it will probably be to help us win an election by uniting the leave vote and then a no-deal Brexit. History is full of such ironies and tragedies.""",0
25,Latest Brexit plan for Boris to squeeze Barnier’s thigh under the negotiating table in attempt to get deal,25," Boris to grope Barnier The Prime Minister will avoid a further extension to the Brexit deadline by going to Brussels and doing what he does best – letting his wandering hands work their magic.  Details of the UK’s proposals for reaching a Brexit deal have been revealed – the Prime Minister is all set to sexually assault Michel Barnier.  “The PM knows exactly what Barnier wants, and he’s man enough to give it to him,” said a Downing Street spokesman.  “Theresa was never bold enough, but Boris has no such inhibitions.”  The Prime Minister suggested that all this Irish backstop nonsense was simply part of a prolonged mating ritual.  “Michel, my belle,” he said. “What a tease he is! He’s been playing hard to get but he’s absolutely gagging for it – I have an excellent nose for these things.  “Barnier normally starts negotiating sessions by sitting opposite me so I’ll start off with a classic bit of footsie. That will encourage him to move seats after the coffee break and take his place by my side.  “As everyone knows, sitting next to somebody is another way of saying, ‘touch me anywhere you like big boy!’  “And I will! I’ll squeeze his juicy thigh through the deliciously tight trousers he always wears especially for my benefit. His crotch will be my oyster!  “I’ll negotiate him like he’s never been negotiated before – he’ll get a satisfying deal all right.  “Hootchie cootchie!”",1
20,Brexit Secretary ordered to surrender cloak of invisibility,20," Stephen Barclay has cloak of invisibility The Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, the Right Honourable Stephen Barclay MP, has been ordered by the Prime Minister, Theresa May, to surrender his government-issue Cloak of Invisibility and get back to work.  Precious little has been seen of Mr Barclay, the MP for North East Cambridgeshire, since his appointment to the role of Brexit Secretary in July 2018. He is the third person to fulfil the role and has been keeping a low profile ever since.  Sightings of Mr Barclay have been scarce since his appointment, although some grainy video footage of him sneaking out of an allotment hut has been leaked to the press. However, the footage has yet to be verified.  It was previously suspected that Mr Barclay may have been hiding under the coats in Chequers or sitting in a park somewhere waiting for the whole sorry Brexit affair to blow over, but it seems that he may have resorted to more desperate measures.  All cabinet members are issued with Cloaks of Invisibility for times of crisis, but they are only to be utilised in extreme cases and even then only for short periods of time.  However, reports indicate that Mr Barclay may have been hiding under his for at least the last year. Meanwhile, Theresa May’s Brexit deal remains stalled in Parliament with no resolution in sight as Britain hurtles towards the deadline with no deal in place.  But now it seems that Mrs May has run out of patience.  “I’ve had ministers going around looking for him all over the place, but no joy as yet,” she said on the steps of Downing Street yesterday.  “If anyone sees him, please tell him we need him to go and do some negotiating asap. Oh, and we want our cloak back too.”",1
18,brexit countdown_bg Created with Sketch.,18," Boris Johnson will make a last-gasp trip to Dublin this week to try to rescue a Brexit compromise after a day in which negotiations with Brussels went up in flames.  He plans to visit Irish leader Leo Varadkar in a bid to convince the premier to help hammer out viable deal, after they had a lengthy telephone call this afternoon.  The 40-minute chat came after the EU accused Boris Johnson of a 'stupid blame game' after he said the bloc had made a deal 'impossible'.  An extraordinary public slanging match broke out after the PM condemned a demand from Angela Merkel for Northern Ireland to stay in the customs union 'forever'.  After the call between Mr Johnson and the Taoiseach, a Downing Street spokesman said: 'Both sides strongly reiterated their desire to reach a Brexit deal.  'They hope to meet in person later this week.'  Mr Johnson (pictured in Downing Street today with European Parliament President David Sassoli) spoke to Leo Varadkar for 40 minutes on the phone  He plans to visit Mr Varadkar in a bid to convince the premier to help hammer out viable deal, after they had a 'constructive' lengthy telephone call this afternoon.  In a pivotal moment drawing battle lines for an election within weeks, Mr Johnson and the German Chancellor has earlier clashed brutally in an early morning phone call.  No10 sources said Mrs Merkel told the premier during the 30-minute showdown that the province must remain within the EU's customs union indefinitely.  But Mr Johnson retorted that her position meant a deal was 'essentially impossible, not just now but ever'.  A Downing Street source said the call - which effectively reads the last rites on hopes for an agreement before next week's EU summit - was a 'clarifying moment'. Mr Johnson now appears certain to boycott the gathering, heralding another low in relations.  'If this represents a new established position then it means a deal is essentially impossible not just now but ever,' the No10 source said. 'It also made clear that they are willing to torpedo the Good Friday Agreement.'  In response, EU council president Donald Tusk ranted on Twitter that the PM was risking the 'security and interests of our people' by refusing to make concessions.  The PM's spokesman swiped back that he had 'chosen to conduct these talks by personal telephone conversations with EU leaders, so I will refrain from commenting on social media'.  Mr Johnson met his Cabinet for crisis talks after the conversation this morning, as ministers stepped up their war footing to go to the country.  The meltdown with the EU appears to have been carefully choreographed, with Brexit minister Michael Gove unveiling a 'preparedness' paper on No Deal shortly after the Merkel bust-up emerged.  Parliament is also due to prorogue tonight ahead of the Queen's Speech - stripping Remainer MPs of their ability to move against the PM.  Downing Street had already painted a grim picture of the consequences of rejecting the UK's 'fair and reasonable' blueprint.  One source - claimed to be maverick strategist Dominic Cummings - explosively claimed overnight that the government will make clear that any EU country supporting a delay to the October 31 Brexit deadline would be engaging in 'hostile interference' in British politics.  Boris Johnson (pictured visiting a hospital in Watford yesterday) is holding a crisis meeting as aides admit the Brexit talks are set to break down dramatically this week  In a crunch moment for negotiations, the PM and German Chancellor Angela Merkel (pictured right in Berlin today) clashed brutally in an early morning phone call. Donald Tusk (left) then accused Mr Johnson of a 'stupid blame game'  EU council president Donald Tusk ranted on Twitter that the PM was risking the 'security and interests of our people' by refusing to make concessions  Jacob Rees-Mogg and Liz Truss were among the ministers gathering in Downing Street today  Former Cabinet minister Amber Rudd claimed maverick No10 aide Dominic Cummings (pictured in Downing Street last week) was behind the explosive briefing  Any hope of cooperation will be 'in the toilet' and the Tories will end all negotiations to fight an election, switching to a policy of leaving the EU immediately with No Deal.  The Tories will win because Parliament and Remainer MPs are 'as popular as the Clap'.  However, tensions in the Cabinet over the hardline approach were exposed today with Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith saying the threat from the No10 source to withdraw security cooperation was 'unacceptable'.  Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan is also thought to have voiced concerns during the meeting this morning.  As the situation threatened to spiral out of control, DUP leader Arlene Foster raged: 'The comments from the German Chancellor to the Prime Minister that Northern Ireland must remain in the EU Customs Union forever now reveal the real objective of Dublin and the European Union.  What happens next in the Brexit crisis? Here is how the coming weeks could pan out: Today: Parliament prorogues at the close of business. There are rumours Boris Johnson could make a statement after talks effectively collapsed. October 14: Parliament is due to return for the Queen's Speech. October 17-18: A crunch EU summit in Brussels, but Mr Johnson now seems certain to boycott the event in protest at the bloc's intransigence. October 19: If there is no Brexit deal by this date Remainer legislation obliges the PM to beg the EU for an extension to avoid No Deal. Jeremy Corbyn has said that he will only let Mr Johnson trigger an election after an extension has been secured. If there is a deal, it will start being rushed through Parliament immediately. October 31: The current deadline for the UK to leave the EU. November/December: An election looks inevitable.  'For the United Kingdom to be asked to leave a part of its sovereign territory in a foreign organisation of which the UK would no longer be a part and over which we would have no say whatsoever is beyond crazy. No UK Government could ever concede such a surrender.  'The EU is not interested in a negotiated outcome at this time. Their position is the UK can only leave with a deal if it agrees a binding piece of international law permanently tying either the whole country or a part of it to the EU's legal order over which it has no control.  'The true purpose of the 'backstop' is now in the open for an to see. Those who eagerly supported the backstop as the best of both worlds can now see the error of that assessment. It was neither temporary nor an insurance policy.'  Nigel Farage tweeted: 'The EU were never going to negotiate in good faith. We simply have to leave with a clean break.'  But shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said the government was trying to 'sabotage' the talks.  'This is yet another cynical attempt by No 10 to sabotage the negotiations,' he said.  'Boris Johnson will never take responsibility for his own failure to put forward a credible deal. His strategy from day one has been for a no-deal Brexit.  'It is now more important than ever that parliament unites to prevent this reckless government crashing us out of the EU at the end of the month.'  While technical talks between officials continued yesterday, EU leaders have so far refused to hold face-to-face talks with Mr Johnson on his plan for replacing the controversial Irish backstop.  The PM said yesterday that Brussels had been presented with 'a big step forward, big advance, big compromise by the UK Government', but complained the EU was not engaging with the details.  And in an incendiary briefing overnight a No10 source told the Spectator: 'They think now that if there is another delay we will keep coming back with new proposals.  'This won't happen. We'll either leave with No Deal on 31 October or there will be an election and then we will leave with No Deal.'  Voters 'are more likely to blame Remainer MPs than Boris Johnson if Brexit is delayed' Voters are more likely to blame Remain-backing MPs and Parliament than Boris Johnson if Brexit is delayed, according to a new poll. A survey conducted by ComRes shows that if the UK's departure date is pushed back beyond October 31 then the PM will be at least partially blamed for the extension by just over half of voters. But crucially for the PM the numbers show that voters will blame other groups far more than they will the premier if he is unable to stick to his 'do or die' Brexit pledge. The statistics represent a boost for Mr Johnson and Downing Street because they come as the chances of a Brexit deal appear to be shrinking while the possibility of an extension past Halloween increases. Number 10 is adamant that the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal but the government has also conceded that it will have to comply with the so-called Benn Act. That anti-No Deal law states that the PM must ask the EU for a delay if the two sides have not struck an accord in the run up to the October 31 deadline. However, Downing Street has made clear that while it will ask for a delay in such circumstances it will also make plain to the EU that it does not want an extension. Should a delay be agreed, the ComRes poll for The Telegraph suggests Mr Johnson would have to shoulder some of the blame. But he is likely to be heartened by the fact other groups would be blamed more than he would.  The brutal assault - which former Cabinet minister Amber Rudd claimed came from Mr Cummings - emerged after Mr Johnson's proposals hit a huge roadblock.  EU politicians have branded them a 'joke' and Emmanuel Macron set a deadline of Friday for the UK to make more concessions.  Upping the ante today, Mr Tusk tweeted directly at Mr Johnson, saying: 'What's at stake is not winning some stupid blame game.  'At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people.  'You don't want a deal, you don't want an extension, you don't want to revoke, quo vadis (where are you going)?'  Irish deputy PM Simon Coveney also waded into the row, saying: 'Hard to disagree - reflects the frustration across EU and the enormity of what's at stake for us all. We remain open to finalize a fair Brexit deal but need a UK Govt willing to work with EU to get it done.'  Asked if the PM was playing a 'blame game', the PM's spokesman shot back: 'Absolutely not. It is not us talking in that language.'  The briefing around the call caused anger in some circles, with claims it misrepresented Mrs Merkel's typically diplomatic approach.  But government sources flatly denied the exchanges had been 'made up'.  It is understood Mr Johnson initially asked for the German Chancellor's 'help' with Michel Barnier because he was 'not negotiating' with the UK.  Mrs Merkel 'let the cat out of the bag' by making clear that Northern Ireland in the customs union was a red line, at which point Mr Johnson insisted that was 'not going to be accepted'.  The source said Mrs Merkel 'did not mean it in an aggressive way', but her words had put the EU's stance into sharp focus.  Ahead of the clashes, Mr Johnson had said yesterday: 'What we're saying to our friends is, this is a very generous, fair and reasonable offer we've made.  'What we'd like to hear from you now is what your thoughts are. And if you have issues with any of the proposals that we've come up with, then let's get into the detail and discuss them.  'It's time for us to get together and really thrash this thing out.'  However, EU officials responded last night by leaking to The Guardian a rejection of the UK's offer.  The 'confidential' report said the Prime Minister's plan to take Northern Ireland out of the customs union would cause 'major disruption to the all-Ireland economy'.  And it said Brussels did not accept that the people of Northern Ireland should be asked to consent to the idea of the province remaining aligned to EU rules after Brexit.  The report is said to have been delivered last Friday to Mr Johnson's chief EU adviser David Frost.  A UK official responded: 'Rather than writing documents in order to leak them, the EU's time would be better spent on engaging with our sensible and fair proposals, so the UK can leave with a deal when we exit the EU on October 31.'  The senior No10 source told The Spectator Irish PM Leo Varadkar had reneged on promises to make concessions alongside the UK.  Mr Varadkar 'said if we moved on manufactured goods then he would also move but instead he just attacked us publicly'.  The source said they would make it clear in public and in private that the interference is not welcome, and any attempt to delay is pointless as Britain will leave regardless on 31 October.  Irish PM Leo Varadkar and EU negotiator Michel Barnier have given short shrift to the UK's Brexit blueprint  A survey conducted by ComRes showed 83 per cent of voters would blame Parliament if Brexit is delayed beyond October 31  Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom and housing minister Esther McVey were at the Cabinet meeting in No10 today  They suggested the government has still not given up on trying to get round the Benn Act, but insisted: 'We will make clear privately and publicly that countries which oppose delay will go to the front of the queue for future cooperation...  'Supporting the delay will be seen by this government as hostile interference in domestic politics, and over half of the public will agree with us.'  Why is the EU's Northern Ireland customs union demand so problematic? Angela Merkel reportedly told Boris Johnson this morning that there could only be a Brexit deal if the UK agreed that Northern Ireland will permanently stay in the EU's customs union. Ms Merkel apparently said that if Britain could not agree to that then a deal was 'overwhelmingly unlikely'. Meanwhile, a Number 10 source said that if that was the EU's negotiating red line then a deal is 'essentially impossible'. The reason the customs demand is so significant, and potentially deal-wrecking, is that it would effectively mean Northern Ireland being treated differently to the rest of the UK forever. Under the plan put forward by Mr Johnson, Northern Ireland would stay in the EU's single market for goods but would leave the customs union at the same time as the rest of Britain. That would enable the province to benefit from any future UK trade deals. If it was kept in the customs union while the rest of the UK left, then it would be excluded from those trade deals. As a result, critics would argue that keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union would leave it out in the cold and isolated - technically still a part of the UK but on a very different path. That is why Mr Johnson - or any other UK PM - would struggle to agree to such a proposal. It would also prompt fury from Unionist politicians who are adamant that Ulster must not be treated differently to the rest of the UK. Labour's Brexit plan would see the whole of the UK in a customs union with the EU and so the question of treating Northern Ireland differently would not arise.  Defence and security cooperation could be affected if the European Union attempted to keep Britain in against its wishes.  The source added: 'Those who supported delay will face the inevitable consequences of being seen to interfere in domestic politics in a deeply unpopular way.'  Spelling out that the Tories will need to harden up their Brexit stance even further to outflank Nigel Farage - who has been demanding a clean break - the source said: 'To marginalise the Brexit Party, we will have to fight the election on the basis of 'No more delays, get Brexit done immediately''.'  In a vicious swipe at Remainer MPs, they added: 'Those who pushed the Benn Act intended to sabotage a deal and they've probably succeeded.  'So the main effect of it will probably be to help us win an election by uniting the leave vote and then a no-deal Brexit. History is full of such ironies and tragedies.'  Asked if the source quote came from Mr Cummings, Ms Rudd told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I think Dominic Cummings, yes, because otherwise it would have been heavily denied and heads would have rolled.  'So clearly it's come from them, it's in their style.  'It reveals that there doesn't appear to be an actual plan at all. Instead, what they're doing is angrily, apparently, begging the EU not to support a delay which will be required because of the position that Parliament has taken.'  With both sides anxious to avoid the blame for a breakdown in talks, Government sources said officials were drawing up their own report setting out concessions Mr Johnson had made after the EU's previous demands.  These include asking Northern Ireland to remain in the single market for goods after Brexit to reduce the need for border checks.  EU diplomats suggested leaders could use the summit to instead discuss another Brexit extension, despite the fact Mr Johnson has ruled out asking for one.  Downing Street yesterday insisted it had not abandoned hopes of a last-minute breakthrough, with Mr Johnson speaking by phone with the leaders of Sweden, Denmark and Poland.  The PM's official spokesman said: 'We are ready to have discussions at pace, but for that to happen the EU needs to engage.' But Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok yesterday said the UK needed to provide 'more realism and reality'.  But one EU official said the most that could be offered with the time left would be reverting to a tweaked 'off-the-shelf' model, such as the Northern Ireland-only backstop.  This is a red line for Mr Johnson as it would involve Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union.",0
32,WWE add Jacob Rees-Mogg v Philip Hammond ‘Brexit showdown’ to Wrestlemania,32," Rees-Mogg Philip Hammond at wrestlemania Two of Britain’s most prominent politicians will finally settle their Brexit differences with a match at next weekend’s Wrestlemania.  World Wrestling Entertainment have added a bout between Jacob Rees-Mogg and Philip Hammond to the Wrestlemania 35 card with the future of Britain on the line.  The Tory politicians will do battle in a steel cage with House of Commons speaker John Bercow as a special guest referee.  After failing to agree any clear Brexit plan, members of the House of Commons have agreed to abide by the result of the no-holds-barred slugfest in New Jersey.  Mr Rees-Mogg, who is expected to compete in his trademark full-length tailcoat and top hat, says victory over the Chancellor of the Exchequer will ensure Britain makes a no-deal exit from the European Union.  But a win for Remain-supporting Hammond would mean Brits are offered a second referendum on their departure from the EU.  WWE owner Vince McMahon said: “This is a grudge match two years in the making and we can’t wait to see this beef finally settled inside the ring.  “Jacob and Philip genuinely don’t like each other so we are confident fans will rush to order the pay-per-view to see them resolve their differences once and for all.”  Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson is expected to be in ‘Brexit Brute’ Rees-Mogg’s corner with pundits predicting the ex-London mayor will find a nefarious way to get involved in the match.  All eyes will be on whether wise-cracking Hammond sneaks his famous red briefcase into the ring.  Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt is set to accompany Hammond to the ring but the match could yet be thrown into doubt as transport secretary Chris Grayling has been asked to book the flights to the United States.",1
21,Hard Brexiters to enrol as super-poo donors after study finds they’re full of shit,21," Brexiter speaking Leading Hard Brexit campaigners are to enrol as shit-donors after a study concluded they are absolutely full of it.  So-called experts claim that individuals who exhibit a healthy amount of faeces pouring from various orifices could be used to help patients suffering from painful bowel conditions such as C Diff, IBS and Farage-Colon.  After listening to Liam Fox spouting shit about a trade deal with Thailand, boffins estimated his entire output contains enough good bacteria to make three pots of brown-flavoured Yakult.  The same group is also eager to hear from anyone who has changed Boris Johnson’s nappy in a professional capacity and was failed to place enough emphasis on washing their hands.  Meanwhile, those advocating a Hard Brexit have been encouraged not to flush and instead bring their movements to the nearest clinic in a Tesco bag – or just throw them over the fence.  Faeces expert, Simon Williams, said, “Sure, there is a certain amount of embarrassment involved in donating your Number Twos, but compare that with the embarrassment caused by calling your son ‘Sixtus’.  “It is no longer enough to merely talk shit, you need to donate it.”  He added, “For the sake of bowel patients everywhere, we will be following through with our research.  “In the meantime, we need a volunteer to walk behind Jacob Rees-Mogg with a glass cylinder and pull out that backstop.”",1
35,Ending freedom of movement could see Santa barred from delivering in the UK after Brexit,35," Santa freedom of movement Changes to Britain’s immigration system after it leaves the European Union may stop Santa Claus from making his annual festive flying visit, it has emerged.  Santa currently uses European freedom of movement rights to fly his sleigh from Lapland into British skies to conduct his annual delivery business.  However, with Britain looking increasingly likely to leave the EU without a deal, the jolly old man is likely to face the same immigration curbs as other Laplanders in future.  Work permits are expected to be introduced, and legal experts warn that the tradition of parents providing a glass of sherry and a mince pie in return for Santa leaving presents by the fireplace constitutes an informal work arrangement – thereby making it impossible for the iconic figure to gain permission to enter the country without the correct paperwork.  Any attempt to make deliveries without permission from the immigration authorities could see Santa arrested, according to legal experts.  Brexit Party leader, chief executive, chairman and owner, Nigel Farage said, “This is just another example of a foreigner coming over here taking the job of a decent hardworking indigenous British national who could easily spend the night delivering presents instead.  “I’ll be delighted to see the end of it.”  In a further complication, the government is believed to favour including reindeer in its annual immigration target.  Boris Johnson is believed to favour a quota of four reindeer per year for the whole country, which friends of Santa say would make the job of pulling his present-laden sleigh close to impossible.  The issue has been raised at cabinet level, with one minister said to have raised concerns that millions of children may be disappointed, only to have been drowned out by shouts of “bah humbug!”  Meanwhile, the Sun is investigating claims that hundreds of Laplanders are cheating immigration controls by masquerading as Santa in shopping centres across the country.  It has published images it claims to be the real Santa supervising elves back in Lapland in the run-up to Christmas while the fake Santas pose for photos with unsuspecting children.",1
28,Women who haven’t had sex with Boris Johnson have absolutely no problem confirming that fact,28," Disgusted woman definitely hasn't had sex with Boris After Jennifer Arcuri refused to say whether or not she’s had sex with Boris Johnson, the many many women who haven’t, insisted they would be perfectly happy confirming that fact.  Arcuri was interviewed on television this morning, but refused to deny sleeping with the then London mayor at the time she was given £120,000 of funding by his office.  However, the millions of women who have not slept with Boris Johnson have insisted that they would be perfectly happy to go on record that at no point has Boris Johnson’s penis been within the vicinity of their vaginas.  Woman, Simone Williams told us, “She was asked, outright, if she had an affair with Boris, and refused to answer saying she had a right to privacy.”  “I get it. I get that everyone has a right to privacy, but why wouldn’t you give that up when the alternative is a nation of people utterly convinced that you’ve had the hunched and sweating form of Boris hanging out the back of you.  “No, I’d much rather give up whatever privacy I have and let it be known, widely and publicly, that I have never had sex with Boris Johnson.  Never.”  Others have agreed with Simone, with one telling us, “I have shagged my fair share of losers, trust me, but I’d draw the line at Boris. Even with beer goggles on I don’t think I could stoop that low.  “Wait, she got a £120,000 out of it? Well, I suppose if we turned the lights off…”",1
36,‘Millennials living in a tent and forced to bake for wealthy old people’ voted best metaphor for Brexit Britain,36," bake off returns The new series of the Great British Bake Off has the youngest ever line up making it the perfect analogy for a post-Brexit society where millennials work hard in crappy accommodation to service the generous pensions of an older generation who call all the shots.  Next week sees the return of the dystopian reality show The Great British Bake Off. Its gritty depictions of a stressed-out baking underclass being lorded over by the wealthy elite have touched hearts and minds for nearly a decade.  TV pundit Simon Williams enjoys making tenuous links between light-entertainment shows and socio-political realities.  “The new series is more relevant than ever as it involves a group of twenty-somethings being totally controlled by the whims of the elderly,” he said.  “Their future employment prospects, social status – indeed, their very dreams – hinge upon the vagaries of older folk who discriminate against anything they view as ‘a bit weird’ even if it’s something as seemingly benign as a slightly undercooked sponge.  “The poor millennials can be seen slaving away over fancy little pastries they could never actually afford to buy themselves. They are forced to live in a field in a tent alongside a dozen strangers because they can’t afford the exorbitant rents of a bedsit flat.  “One by one, no matter how hard they work, they will be dismissed to the terrible void of anonymity. Only one will be allowed to embrace the capitalist dream, sell out their principles and betray their comrades by writing a cookbook and maybe becoming a tyrant TV presenter themselves.  “Make no mistake – the Bake Off tent is every British Street and Prue Leith is every aged Brexit voter who wants to maintain the status quo which was gifted to them but from which they benefit so much.  “Or, maybe it’s just about cakes and stuff.”",1
34,You and your poor attitude to blame for no-deal Brexit,34,"Boris blaming you for no deal Brexit The government has launched a stinging attack on you for your poor attitude during the past three years leading to what appears to be an inevitable no-deal outcome to Brexit.  It launched the attack on you after first attempting to blame the EU, Theresa May, Labour, the Lib Dems, Extinction Rebellion and Gary Lineker for its inability to negotiate sensibly like grown-ups.  “Sat there in your pants on the sofa, eating coco-pops from the box, you’re a bloody disgrace,” said Chancellor for the Duchy of something or other, Michael Gove.  “I don’t know what help you thought that was going to be. I mean, Boris said it, we all need to get pull together and get behind Britain and what did you do? You watched Casualty and went to bed.  “Well, I hope you’re happy now, because we’re going to crash out of Europe with no deal and it’s all your fault.”  Mr Gove was unwilling to accept that the abject failure of statecraft was the result of ineptitude and bafflement at the heart of Boris Johnson’s government.  He went on, “Rubbish. The whole thing is entirely your fault for going to the pub rather than backing Britain for its optimistic future and all that.”  The news that no-deal Brexit is your fault comes in the wake of the Tory government blaming you for having to introduce a pointless and fruitless ten-year programme of crippling austerity.  “Well, it certainly wasn’t our fault,” continued Mr Gove.  “Frankly, you need to sort yourself out.”",1
38,"Brexiters demand future negotiations be carried out in railway car near Compiegne, France",38," Train carriage for Brexit negotiations Brexit supporters have demanded that future negotiations with the EU regarding Brexit are carried out in a Railway Car near Compiegne, France.  It is hoped that by doing so, it will remind the Europeans of World War I, which was won single-handedly by England, and they will remember their place and stop being so uppity.  “It seems that this entire process would have gone a great deal more smoothly had those ghastly Europeans remembered who won the Great War,” said a red-faced man, angry about something or other.  “I think that by giving them a little reminder of when Germany, who lost the Great War, surrendered to England, who won it, then they’d remember that we’re best and they should damn well do as their told.”  The original wagon was destroyed during World War II, or so the Germans claim, there is every chance they’re just hiding it to avoid a situation like this.  It’s the sort of thing they’d do.  As such, Brexiters have proposed that we use one of those old slammy-door trains from the seventies as a symbol of when we didn’t need Europe and could have bananas that were so bendy they were a circle.  “Obviously, we want to maintain good relations with Europe,” continued the red-faced man.  “But, there’s no harm in reminding them that when it comes to wars, England always win, and we’ll win with Brexit, which is definitely a sort of war.”  Hearing of the plan, the EU issued an immediate response – “peu importe.”  It is unknown what the words mean as they appear to not be English",1
22,"’ll be wearing blue face paint and riding a horse to Brexit talks with PM, confirms Nicola Sturgeon",22," Nicola Sturgeon Nicola Sturgeon has today confirmed that she will be seeking to make a fearsome impression as she meets with the Prime Minister in London today to discuss her Brexit deal.  The tiny SNP warrior will be hoping to come across as a brave leader who would give her life for Scotland’s best interests, namely independence, as she meets with Theresa May to discuss the Prime Minister’s withdrawal agreement for Brexit.  “This will be one of the biggest meetings of Nicola’s life,” a close aide of the First Minister, Simon McWilliams told reporters.  “The future of Scotland in a post-Brexit world hangs in the balance, and she’ll be damned if she’s going to stand by and let Scotland be dragged down with the rest of Britain.”  He continued, “In preparation for the meeting, Nicola asked me to order some blue face paint, a claymore and a horse so that she can be fully prepared to fight for an independent Scotland, free from the evil, corrupt rule of the English gentry, whatever that means.  “No-one knows where her inspiration for this has come from, but for the past fortnight she has just locked herself away, watching the same film over and over again and yelling ‘FREEDOM!’ repeatedly.  “I haven’t seen it, but apparently it was directed by and starred an American, so I don’t see the connection.”  He continued, “Still, if it works and she successfully battles for Scotland’s best interests then it will have been worth her looking a bit daft.”  He added, “And I’m she’ll use the opportunity to threaten Scottish independence.  “Er, again.”",1
27,"Government denies that Brexit proposal titled ‘F*ck You, Eurotrash’ was designed to fail",27," Boris Johnson EU deal Boris Johnson’s team have reacted furiously to a suggestion by Michel Barnier that the UK’s proposals were obviously designed to blame the EU for No Deal as it contained no workable solution to the Irish border question but over 400 insults directed at each European nation.  The EU claimed that having the foul-smelling document, delivered late by a sullen teenager and addressed to Frogface Barmier, was a calculated move to ensure rejection, and allow Boris Johnson to claim any No Deal fallout was the EU’s fault. Something categorically denied by Simon Williams MP, a junior minister for DexEU.  He explained, “We made our proposals in good faith and were never seeking to insult that assorted bunch of workshy wine drinkers that would all be German speakers if it weren’t for us.  “It is possible that there might have been a few cases of auto-corrected typos that changed perfectly sensible offers on cross-border veterinary certificates to words like Vespa riding whop or humourless kraut boxhead. But frankly, that is to be expected when things are done in urgency just as it is normal for legal documents to have a few faecal smears on them.”  Mr Williams also denied that Brexit policy was now only done with a view to capture the far-right vote and soothe ERG eurosceptics such as himself.  “If those unwashed eurocrats want to pretend to be offended then that’s nothing to do with us.  “As for me, I do not like the EU but I love Europe. That’s why I have a lovely vineyard and converted windmill in the Bordeaux area where my wife has claimed permanent residence.  “I’m even watching ‘Allo ‘Allo! to learn their bizarre donkey-braying language.”",1
4,"Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures — and in these Brexit times, extraordinary words among leaders.",4," Some British officials have previously compared the European Union to Nazis and Soviets, and EU Council President Donald Tusk said there was ""a special place in hell"" for some Brexiteers.  Tuesday saw the latest chapter in vitriolic invective among two sides claiming they want the most loving split-up ever, but too often display fits of pique in what is heading for a fighting, flaming divorce that bodes ill for future cooperation between neighbors.  With negotiations on the U.K.'s departure terms from the EU hanging precariously in the balance at a time when silence seemed golden, both sides broke the spell Tuesday.  In a tweet dripping with anger, Tusk directly addressed Johnson at his twitter handle @BorisJohnson and gave him his fill about the fast crumbling Brexit negotiations:  ""You don't want a deal, you don't want an extension, you don't want to revoke, quo vadis?"" — Latin for ""where are you heading?"" and a reminder of a less harsh era of diplomacy.  It was a rhetorical question anyhow, since Tusk had already analyzed recent British behavior when it came to Brexit and decided that Johnson mainly wanted to head for the EU's exit door as soon as possible and pile all the blame for fraught negotiations heading toward failure onto Tusk and the EU.  ""What's at stake is not winning some stupid blame game,"" Tusk told Johnson. If it is still mild by the standards of the other Donald, U.S. President Donald Trump, it immediately set European media alight.  What raised his ire was a London anonymous government debrief which said that the EU was now ""willing to torpedo the Good Friday Agreement,"" which has kept the peace on the island of Ireland for the past two decade, and claimed that EU made sure that ""a deal is essentially impossible.""  Those two elements have been anathema to EU and German thinking so far and both denied it. At EU headquarters it was seen as a ploy to simply blame the 27 remaining member states for whatever goes wrong before the official breakup.  The German government said it never comments on such confidential telephone conversations between leaders and insisted it was still looking for a deal to avoid the chaotic exit.  That is now set for Oct. 31 if there is no last-minute turnaround for a deal. The deadline could still be extended.  The inflammatory view by the British government of the German stance immediately fired up passions.  Arlene Foster, the leader of the DUP Northern Irish party aligned to Johnson, said that the idea her region would stay in an EU customs union was ""beyond crazy. No. U.K. government could ever concede such a surrender.""  Johnson also likes to use the word surrender, as if the UK and EU were at war, calling Parliament's anti no-deal bill the ""surrender act.""  If not real war, it has turned into a war of words — which is nothing new for the British prime minister.  After all, Johnson once compared Brexit to Allied prisoners escaping German prison camps in ""some sort of World War II movie."" And he already compared the EU's aims to those of Adolf Hitler, arguing the bloc was trying to create a super state that mirrored the Nazi leader's attempts to dominate the European continent.  And only last year, then foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt likened the EU to the totalitarian Soviet Union.  Tuesday was not the first time Tusk was pushed to the brink by Brexiteers.  ""I have been wondering what a special place in hell looks like for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of plan how to carry it out safely,"" Tusk said early this year.  Tusk, Merkel and Johnson are slated to spend a long summit meeting together next week to decide on the fate of the Brexit negotiations. There will be plenty to talk about.  ———  Jill Lawless contributed to this report from London.  ———  Follow AP's full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit",0
6,The Latest on Brexit (all times local):,6," 5:30 p.m.  The European Parliament's chief Brexit official is warning proponents of a no-deal divorce in Britain that the thorny issues that have hobbled discussions won't miraculously go away.  Belgian MEP Guy Verhofstadt said issues about the future relationship between Britain and the European Union will remain and perhaps prove more intractable in a no-deal Brexit scenario.  He said that ""people were thinking in Britain: 'oh yeah, we can do a no-deal and then we go sitting around the table and we are going to talk about a future relationship and everything will be fine'.""  Verhofstadt said that would ""be nuts. No way.""  Britain is scheduled to leave the EU at the end of the month.  The EU has been consistent in saying that in a no-deal scenario, the questions over citizens' rights, Britain's divorce bill and the Irish border will need to be sorted out before discussions over the future trading relationship begins.  ———  11:50 a.m.  European Council President Donald Tusk has angrily addressed British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a tweet that Brexit is not ""some stupid blame game"" and directly asked him where he wants to take the fast deteriorating negotiations.  After Downing Street offered an extremely negative reaction to a phone call between Johnson and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Tusk quickly retorted that the EU-U.K. talks weren't about apportioning blame if the divorce turns out to be a chaotic and costly no-deal exit.  Tusk tweeted to Johnson: ""what's at stake is not winning some stupid blame game. At stake is the future of Europe and the UK.""  ———  10:15 a.m.  The British government says it still hopes to strike a Brexit deal with the European Union, despite mounting gloom on both sides of the Channel about the chances of success.  EU leaders have demanded more ""realism"" from Britain in response to a Brexit plan proposed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The bloc says the proposals don't fulfil the U.K.'s commitment to a frictionless border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.  French President Emmanuel Macron says the EU will assess by Friday whether a deal is possible.  The British government says the U.K. will leave on Oct. 31 with or without a divorce deal, and is taking steps to minimize the pain of a no-deal exit.  It's due to publish more details of planning for a no-deal Brexit on Tuesday.  ———  Follow AP's full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit",0
24,"Corbyn would overrule the referendum and wreck the economy, says government trying to implement a disastrous no-deal Brexit that nobody voted for",24," Boris going for no deal Brexit The government is insisting that a Prime Minister Corbyn would betray the result of the EU referendum and ruin the UK economy – so a bit like a no-deal Brexit then.  Downing Street has responded to Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to oust Boris Johnson and prevent a no-deal Brexit by claiming it would both negatively impact the economy and undermine British democracy.  “It’s a bit like the toaster calling the kettle Onyx Black,” said middle-class Political Analyst Simon Williams.  “There’s very little chance of Corbyn ruining the economy more than the reckless no-deal Brexit that Boris Johnson is marching towards.  “To mention just a few things:  “A third of our food comes from the EU so that will be more expensive.  “Three-quarters of our medicines come via the EU so they will be more expensive – perhaps prohibitively so.  “Any business which obtains supplies from the EU will see a rise in costs. Major UK employers – such as those in the car industry – will struggle, threatening jobs and livelihoods.  “No-deal uncertainty is predicted to cause house prices to fall by up to 30%, pushing 90% of first-time buyers from the last few years into negative equity.  “As for democracy, while there’s a mandate for leaving the EU there certainly isn’t one for leaving without a deal. Boris himself talked about a ‘great deal’ with the EU. Just a month ago he described a no-deal Brexit as a million to one chance.  “People understandably voted for the very specific benefits they were promised by politicians and vehicles.  “I mean, would the Tories publish a manifesto, fight a general election on that basis and then do the exact opposite when in power?  “Right, yes. We shouldn’t really be surprised should we?”  Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn has responded to news that rebel Tory MPs might be willing to support him.  “Shiiiit,” he said while running to the sanctuary of his allotment.",1
15,"Image caption Tony Blair said he believed a no-deal Brexit was a ""threat"" to the United Kingdom",15," Tony Blair has said the prospect of a no-deal Brexit is a boost for those supporting Scottish independence.  The former prime minister said the chances of the UK leaving the EU without a deal have increased on the basis of latest briefings from No 10.  But Mr Blair said a deal with the EU was still possible.  In an interview with BBC Scotland, Mr Blair also acknowledged that he now finds it a ""struggle"" to support Labour.  He said: ""A no-deal Brexit is a threat to the United Kingdom, there is no doubt about that.  ""It is a threat to Northern Ireland, it is a threat to Scotland remaining in the UK,  ""Do I hope either of these things happen? No, of course not and I will argue strongly against it.""  Mr Blair added that a no-deal Brexit would give supporters of independence an ""additional argument that they did not have before"".  Image copyright PA Media Image caption Angela Merkel and Boris Johnson spoke on the phone on Tuesday morning and this has led to reports that the chances of a Brexit deal have decreased  Reflecting on reports that a Brexit deal is ""essentially impossible"" after a call between the prime minister Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel, Mr Blair said there needed to be better conduct in negotiations.  He added: ""On the basis of the way the government has behaved today I think a no deal is more likely.  ""I think there is a genuine desire on the part of Europe to reach a deal if at all possible, no-one sensible wants a no deal.  ""Let's see what happens over the next days but if the government is seriously going to assemble the semblance of a deal it has got to stop doing these briefings and stop conducting its business through the media.""  Asked about his personal support for the party he led for 13 years, Mr Blair added that ""It's a struggle for me with Labour and I am quite open about that.""  'Elephant trap'  Speaking at another event in Edinburgh, a lunch organised by the Scottish Parliamentary Journalists' Association, Mr Blair warned about a UK government briefing that the Tories would contest an election on a platform supporting a no-deal Brexit.  He said: ""The strategy is laid out very clearly, and it's a vast elephant trap of great width and depth, with neon signs flashing around it saying: 'Elephant trap - elephants of limited awareness please fall in'.  ""They should avoid that.""  Mr Blair added: ""The right thing is indeed to go back to the people but I beg you, please, not by way of a general election.  ""To mix a general election up with the specific issue of Brexit is wrong in principle and it's wrong in the politics.""",0
39,Brexit indicative vote breakthrough after MPs finally settle on “more arse cheeks”,39," parliament wants more arsecheek Parliament finally released the UK from Brexit purgatory as a late addition to yesterday’s indicative vote won a slim majority and ordered the government to deliver a plan based around lovely bottoms wiggling in the Strangers Gallery.  The Conservative MP for Lutterworth South, Simon Williams, is widely credited for including the buttocks option. An addition he claimed was a sudden flash of inspiration.  “Once again we were presented with several choices, none of which command a majority or that I understand. So I did my usual and looked up while daydreaming about what I would say on Newsnight if they ever invite me. And then it struck me! What if we stopped talking about boring things like Custom Unions and focused more on pert posteriors? One word with John Bercow and it was on the ballot. He loves a plump rump too.”  However, the issue was far from settled as it would require the government to quickly create a derriere-based plan of action and submit it to the EU 27. Although likely to be welcomed in Brussels, the plan might not get that far as Theresa May as always been a strong opponent of all backsides, wiggling or static.  A spokesperson for Downing Street seemed to confirm this late last night by telling journalists that a Brexit based on bountiful bums had not been validated through a general election in the same way her plans were.  “Parliament has no mandate to assume the people want a bootylicious Brexit whereas Theresa May did win an election in 2017  “And everyone knows she is all about the cock.”",1
1,"From the sound of Downing Street’s account of Boris Johnson’s fateful phone call with Angela Merkel yesterday, his charms do not have the same effect on her that they did on pole-dancing American businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri.",1," The German Chancellor gave him, or more specifically his Brexit proposals, the diplomatic cold shoulder.  Her blunt statement that any chance of a deal was ‘overwhelmingly unlikely’ appeared to kill off dwindling hopes of a breakthrough in talks between the Government and Brussels.  By convention, officials play down any disagreement in private conversations between their political masters. For example, in their lexicon of euphemisms, raging rows are described as ‘constructive debates’.  The German Chancellor Angela Merkel (right) gave Boris Johnson (left), or more specifically his Brexit proposals, the diplomatic cold shoulder, writes SIMON WALTERS  Yet officials in No 10 went out of their way to do the opposite yesterday. Gone was any attempt to gloss over differences. They ramped up the rhetoric by claiming Merkel’s comments meant ‘a deal is essentially impossible not just now... but ever’.  The provocative nature of the briefing, though, paled into insignificance compared to a rant, made public 12 hours earlier, by a No 10 insider who swore death and destruction to anyone who tried to stop the UK cutting ties with Brussels on October 31.  The Downing Street ‘source’ quoted by The Spectator bore the unmistakably contemptuous and crude tone of Johnson’s de facto chief of staff Dominic Cummings.  The ‘source’ made a series of extra-ordinary, lurid claims, including that it was a ‘delusion’ to think Merkel would help Britain; warning that if the talks failed, any prospect of the UK ‘sincerely co-operating’ with the EU ‘will be in the toilet’; rounding on MPs plotting to stop Brexit by highlighting their precarious standing in a Parliament ‘as popular as the clap’; and accusing Irish PM Leo Varadkar of ratting on a promise to make concessions in return for a similar move by Johnson.  Thankfully, Johnson was more dignified when he spoke to Merkel. But his message was essentially the same.  He told her that talks on his Brexit proposals were ‘close to breaking down’, he was not convinced ‘there was any desire for negotiation’ from Brussels and that European leaders holding out in expectation of Brexit being reversed by a second referendum were barking up the wrong tree.  With just a week to go before the EU summit – the last opportunity to thrash out a deal – it seems both sides have given up any hope of agreement.  We are entering the end-game of a complex – yet fruitless – series of negotiations that began more than six years ago when David Cameron set out Britain’s problems with the EU and pledged to hold an in-out referendum on Britain’s membership.  Predictably, EU president Donald Tusk, who once spoke of a ‘special place in hell’ for ‘those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan’, led the EU’s counter-attack on Johnson. Tusk accused him of ‘playing a stupid blame game’ – a charge repeated by Labour’s Brexit spokesman and wannabe leader Keir Starmer. Officially, the Prime Minister is clinging to his pledge that if he cannot get a deal he will take the UK out of the EU on October 31 without one. Unofficially, his allies admit the chances are very slim. His hands are tied by the Benn Act, which stipulates that he must ask Parliament’s permission on any Brexit deal. He also faces a ‘rebel alliance’ of Labour, Lib Dems, Scots Nats and a former Tory MPs who lost the party whip for opposing No Deal.  Politically, economically, constitutionally and socially, the long-term future of Britain will be decided in the coming weeks.  The Downing Street ‘source’ quoted by The Spectator bore the unmistakably contemptuous and crude tone of Johnson’s de facto chief of staff Dominic Cummings, writes SIMON WALTERS  On a personal level, Johnson’s credibility is at stake. Above all, how would the public react if he failed to deliver on his promise that Britain will leave the EU on October 31, ‘do or die’?  Nearly everyone in Westminster agrees this would mean a general election in November is inevitable. Even charismatic Johnson may struggle to sweet-talk people into blaming everyone else – Parliament, Brussels and the judges – rather than himself.  The opinion polls give him a decent lead over Labour. But an election held after Johnson had so dramatically failed would play into the hands of both Jeremy Corbyn and Nigel Farage.  Indeed, I believe the threat to the Tories would be greater from the latter and his Brexit Party. They will accuse the Government of betraying the 17.4 million who voted Leave, dishonouring democracy by failing to implement the referendum result and sacrificing the country’s interests because of Conservative Party infighting. They will argue that we have no choice but to leave the EU without a deal.  And therein lies Johnson’s next big dilemma. To win an election he must get the support of disaffected pro-Leave Tories who were among those who voted the Brexit Party into first place in this year’s Euro election.  As the Downing Street ‘source’ made clear yesterday, hardliners surrounding Johnson want him to campaign on an unequivocal No Deal manifesto.  Wisely, former Tory leader William Hague articulated the horror felt by mainstream Eurosceptic Tories at such a scorched-earth approach. He said: ‘A hardline election message, shorn of any hope of compromise, will leave many traditional but moderate Tories with their pencils hovering over the Lib Dem box on polling day.’  Ironically, although polar opposites in style and language, moderate Hague and manic Cummings want the same thing: A Brexit deal by October 31.  And it is just possible that there is one tiny, common ray of hope in the utterances from both Hague and the ‘source’ who briefed The Spectator.  It is Hague’s suggestion that the only chance of getting a deal in the few days left is to put a time limit on the controversial Northern Ireland backstop. This, he concedes, would ‘involve a climbdown’ by Johnson, Varadkar and Brussels but, he insists it is the best solution for all three.  At the same time, the ‘source’ forecast that Brussels will make a last-minute offer of a time-limited backstop but predicted that Johnson would reject it, adding: ‘That will probably be the end.’ This could explain Downing Street’s angry reaction to Merkel’s comments to the PM. She reportedly said Northern Ireland would have to stay in the customs union ‘for ever’, although Berlin disputed No 10’s version of the conversation.  More pragmatic voices close to Johnson would urge the PM to grab any olive branch with both hands as the best way to pull himself out of his – and Europe’s – Brexit nightmare.",0
31,New evidence that Karma exists after report finds Leave-voting areas will be hardest hit by no-deal Brexit,31," Karma as Vote leave areas hit worst by no deal What goes around may indeed come around, according to new research carried out last week.  A report leaked yesterday has revealed that 29 out of 33 areas that would be hardest hit by a no-deal Brexit were ones that had actually voted for the monumental act of national self-harm.  The list of the areas that would be most vulnerable to job losses in the event of Britain leaving without a deal was compiled under the codename ‘Operation Kingfisher’, and was marked as ‘highly confidential’, presumably because the government wanted to hide the fact that a number of areas had overwhelmingly voted to shoot themselves in the foot.  Simon Williams, a Leave voter from Dover who is in favour of Brexit because his only source of information is the Daily Mail and the Leave.EU Facebook page, reacted with surprise to the news.  He told us, “Hang on, I voted to leave in 2016 because the paper said that Romanians would take my job, then claim my benefits, and then kill my family dog, or something. Plus I didn’t want the Muslims to ban Christmas.”  “I haven’t actually spoken to any Romanians, or met any Muslims – to confirm this – but it’s just a well-known fact, innit. So I thought, you know, get out of Europe and then there’ll be loads of jobs to go round.  “It’s weird – Boris Johnson said that Brexit would be good for jobs, so I don’t get it. It’s not like him to lie, is it?”  Government spokesperson Christopher James told press this morning, “We are devastated by this. Not by the fact that there will be job losses – by the fact that our report was leaked, revealing that the areas that voted to leave might suffer job losses.  “But some new jobs will be created – we will need parking attendants in Dover when it becomes one huge lorry park, for a start.”",1
30,Opinion: Brexit is going brilliantly and is only making Britain richer,30," Happy man happy with Brexit Last Friday, March 29th, marked two years since Britain took the heroic step of triggering Article 50. That makes today, April the First, the ideal moment to step back and look at the incredible success that the process has been – and to look forward to the sunlit uplands promised.  Thanks to the foresight and meticulous planning by the Leave campaign before the referendum was even held, Britain is in a strong position to face the world with a confidence it has not felt in a generation.  The people are unified. The victors in the referendum were gracious in their victory; conducting a hearts and minds campaign to reassure the defeated and win over the undecided. Their dignity and generosity to their countrymen, who they say they love and want only the best for, has been an object lesson in how to behave that we can all learn from.  Other nations across the globe have made their intentions clear: the moment our departure from the EU is complete they will offer the same or more generous trade terms to an independent Britain than we currently have within the European Union.  Meanwhile, decisive and above all bridge-building leadership from all sides of Parliament the division and ineffectual indecisiveness warned of before the referendum have not come to pass.  Leaders like Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon and above all Theresa May have put aside their personal feelings and worked with a unified front to achieve the best for the whole country.  This truly British ability to pull as one has impressed  – nay, awed – our continental counterparts who have in turn fractured and now garble in a cacophony of 27 separate nations unable to reach a single voice.  It can truly be said that party politics and factional infighting have not marred the process from our side of the table. We at NewsThump have to hold up our hands and admit, Brexit has made Britain great again.",1
33,Special Relationship triumph as US extends middle finger of friendship over hit-and-run driver,33," special relationship The famous Special Relationship, that is the cornerstone of Boris Johnson’s post-Brexit trade policy, once again proved its worth as the US State Department penned a lovely letter telling Northamptonshire police it could ‘go fuck itself’ over lifting the immunity of a diplomat’s wife who allegedly killed a British teenager.  A spokesperson for the Foreign Office, Simon Williams, insisted the way that the US refused to allow one of their own to face British justice showed how deep the bonds were between the two countries.  He went on, “Had we been French or German, this would have created a huge diplomatic kerfuffle as they would have insisted that the life of their citizens is more important than sucking up to Washington.  “But we have a smooth system in place where Americans who kill Britons can easily leave the country unchallenged and we can all get back to planning photo-op visits to the White House.  “Thanks to the ancient and strong ties between our two countries, the Americans are extremely contrite when telling us they would never let an official’s spouse face a British court. In the same way, they are so polite when they told us we could sit on pencil and twirl as they won’t send their naval assets to help free our ship from the Iranians.”  Mr Williams was asked if the Special Relationship was less of a diplomatic reality and more a way for British politicians to pass themselves off as important global statesmen to the dwindling number of UK constituents who still believe the UK mattered.  He concluded, “That’s not true. We’re their favourite country. We have a Queen! Israel is just a passing fad!”",1
26,Britain to repeat its Brexit offer loudly and slowly until the foreigners get it,26," MPs want May to explain Brexit deal slowly to EU In dramatic scenes last night, Parliament voted for Theresa May to return to Brussels and repeat their offer loudly and slowly until the foreigners get it.  The EU has repeatedly rejected the proposals because they’re a bit slow and obviously didn’t understand them the first time, but senior figures within parliament are confident that loudly saying ‘SPEAKEE ENGLISHEE’ will break the deadlock.  “The first time we explained the deal we’re after, Michel Barnier just cupped one ear and said ‘Que?’, so we think there’s room for movement there,” said MP Simon Williams.  ”All Theresa May has to do to make Parliament happy is get the deal we have been specifically told isn’t on the table – and she can do that by raising her voice and enunciating ev-er-y syl-lab-ble. Like that,” he added.  “If I were Prime Minister I would have done it by now. It would have been dead easy, but I know how to talk to foreigners as I holiday in the Peloponnese every year.”  Theresa May is to return to Brussels this morning with a dead and empty expression behind her eyes.",1

He has hit back at criticism of how the EU had handled the Brexit negotiations.  He said EU leaders had been ""straight up"" in their dealings with the UK.  His comments come after a Downing Street source said German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Boris Johnson that a deal based on the UK's latest offer was ""overwhelmingly unlikely"".  Mr Varadkar told Irish national broadcaster RTÉ the UK had ""repudiated"" the withdrawal agreement that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's predecessor Theresa May had struck with the EU and ""sort of put half of that back on the table"".  ""[They] are saying that's a concession and of course it isn't really,"" he added.

The taoiseach and Mr Johnson had a conversation by telephone earlier on Tuesday evening.  What else happened on Tuesday?  Mr Johnson spoke to the German chancellor on Tuesday morning about the UK's new proposals.  A No 10 source claimed Mrs Merkel said a deal would never be possible unless Northern Ireland stayed in a customs union.  The BBC understands there was ""scepticism"" in the EU that Mrs Merkel would have used such language.  European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted Mr Johnson, warning him against a ""stupid blame game"".  Irish Foreign Minister Coveney said there was a ""lot of misinformation"" being reported and that his government and the EU were ""working flat out"" to achieve a Brexit deal.  Last week, the UK published new proposals designed to replace the backstop in the original withdrawal agreement, which would have kept the UK in a temporary customs territory with the EU.  Mr Johnson had rejected the backstop as ""anti-democratic"", putting forward a plan to take the whole of the UK out of the customs union.  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A new Brexit deal is possible but cannot come at any cost, says Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney  That would mean a new customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland with new requirements for cross-border traders.  The UK government has said it believes the impact of that can be minimised with any checks taking place away from the border.  But the Irish government and the EU did not react positively to the proposals.  Analysis: Has hope of a Brexit deal died?  By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political reporter  Given the ramped-up political blame game that seems to have been taking place in recent days it's perhaps not surprising that this is where things have gotten to.  The DUP remains firmly on the side of Number 10, insisting detail from the phone call proves the EU wants to keep Northern Ireland in a customs union ""forever"".  Compare that with what the Irish government and EU say about needing fair proposals from Downing Street and a ""willing"" negotiating partner.  It would seem the obstacles are intractable but don't rule anything out yet.  Deal, delay and no-deal are all still possible options, much to the concern of other Stormont parties and businesses in Northern Ireland waiting for a clear way forward.  At Stormont on Tuesday, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) clashed with other Northern Ireland political parties about attempts to get a Brexit deal.  DUP leader Arlene Foster said the reported comments from Mrs Merkel revealed the EU was ""not interested"" in a negotiated outcome.  ""The prime minister's proposals have flushed out Dublin's real intentions to trap Northern Ireland in the EU customs union forever, where Dublin rather than the United Kingdom's elected representatives would be in the driving seat,"" she added.  ""We will not accept any such ultimatum or outcome.""  Image copyright AFP Image caption Arlene Foster says it is unacceptable for Northern Ireland to stay in the customs union  SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said EU leaders were ""more in tune"" with people in Northern Ireland than the UK government or the DUP.  ""The British government, aided and abetted by the DUP... should set aside the Downing Street war games and finally listen to what people here are saying,"" he added.  Ulster Unionist Party leader Robin Swann said Northern Ireland was sitting on the ""brink of a no-deal disaster"".  ""Politicians in the EU and our own government are treating Northern Ireland like a chess piece in a very high risk game,"" he said.  ""The UK government is more interested in a game of 'he said, she said' than producing a viable alternative.""  Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith distanced himself from a Downing Street briefing about the state of the Brexit negotiations.  In a piece published in the Spectator, a source claimed EU countries that supported another extension to the Brexit deadline would go to ""the bottom of the queue"" on future co-operation, including on defence and security matters.

3,brexit countdown_bg Created with Sketch.,3," Boris Johnson's hopes of striking a new Brexit deal with the EU were dashed today after a furious early morning phone call with Angela Merkel.  The German Chancellor is believed to have told the Prime Minister the only way for a new agreement to be struck would be for the UK to agree to Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union.  Mr Johnson refused and just like that the path to an accord appeared to vanish while the chances of a No Deal split increased dramatically.  So what happens now? Below are all of the answers to all of the key questions as Britain braces for three weeks of Brexit chaos.  What happened today?  In simple terms the Brexit negotiations went up in flames. Ms Merkel reportedly told Mr Johnson the only way for the two sides to agree a deal would be if the PM agreed for Northern Ireland to stay in the EU's customs union 'forever'.  Such an approach would avoid the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland and would mean the Irish backstop could be scrapped.  But it would also mean Northern Ireland effectively being separated from the rest of the UK.  Mr Johnson apparently told Ms Merkel that her position meant a deal was 'essentially impossible, not just now but ever'.  Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, then upped the stakes as he publicly criticised Mr Johnson.  Mr Tusk claimed the PM was trying to win 'some stupid blame game' as he accused him of not actually wanting a deal.  What does this mean for the Brexit talks?  It appears Mr Johnson's 'final offer' on Brexit - which he only submitted to the EU last Wednesday - is now officially dead with the bloc of the view that the PM's blueprint cannot act as the basis for a formal divorce agreement.  With just 23 days until the October 31 deadline that means the chances of a disorderly split from the bloc have gone up significantly.  Downing Street is not willing to compromise any further and the EU does not believe Mr Johnson's ideas on how to delete the backstop are workable.  It is therefore hard, if not impossible, to see how the two sides could arrive at a deal within the next three weeks.  So what happens next?  Mr Johnson will prorogue Parliament this evening as he prepares to set out his new domestic legislative agenda in a Queen's Speech next Monday.  Ending the Parliamentary session today means that the PM will not face difficult Brexit questions in the Commons for the rest of this week.  That will in theory allow him to focus all of his energies on Brexit. Brussels had suggested the end of this week would be the moment when the two sides would know whether an agreement could be struck before a crunch EU summit on October 17.  If there is no agreement by close of play on Friday then the bloc's attentions will then switch to whether to offer the UK a Brexit delay.  However, given the acrimony today following the PM's call with Ms Merkel, it looks likely that both sides already know that they will not agree a deal.  The effective collapse of the talks has prompted rumours that Mr Johnson could make a statement in Downing Street setting out his proposed next steps but nothing has been confirmed.  Why is this EU summit so important?  The scheduled European Council meeting in Brussels on October 17-18 is the last one due to take place before the Halloween Brexit deadline.  It had been earmarked as the last moment at which a deal could be agreed between Britain and the bloc.  But the chances of an accord being signed off at the summit now appear minuscule.  It is likely that instead of focusing on a deal the summit will now focus on whether a Brexit delay will be offered to the UK.  If a deal is off the table in the run up to the summit it is possible that Mr Johnson could choose to boycott the get together entirely.  If the PM's deal is dead, does that mean there will be a No Deal Brexit?  It is hard to answer this question definitively for a number of reasons.  MPs have passed an anti-No Deal law - the so-called Benn Act - which will force the PM to ask Brussels to push back the Brexit date to January 31 next year if no agreement has been made by October 19.  Assuming the EU agrees to such an extension then a No Deal Brexit will be avoided.  But the PM and the government remains adamant that the UK will leave the bloc with or without a deal on October 31.  Number 10 has conceded that it will have to comply with the Benn Act and ask for a delay.  Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel, pictured in Berlin in September, today had a fiery phone call in which the German Chancellor reportedly told the PM Northern Ireland would need to stay in the EU customs union for a Brexit deal to be agreed  But Downing Street has also said it intends to make clear in public and private to the EU that the government does not actually want an extension in the hope that Brussels will refuse to offer one.  So it is possible that the government will ask the EU for a delay (as required by the law) while also telling the bloc not to grant one.  In those circumstances the UK's Brexit fate will rest entirely in the hands of the EU. If the bloc was to rule out an extension then the UK would leave without an agreement on Halloween.  What is Boris Johnson's five-point plan to scrap the Irish backstop? Single market Northern Ireland would leave the Customs' Union with the rest of the UK but stay in the single market. This would constitute an 'all island regulatory zone' that covers trade of all goods. It would mean no checks between the two nations, because Northern Ireland would still have to follow EU rules. Goods from Britain to Northern Ireland would effectively be managed by a border in the Irish Sea, with checks only in that direction, not the reverse. Stormont Lock The 'all island regulatory zone' will have to be approved by the people of Northern Ireland. This means the Northern Ireland Assembly has the right to veto the zone and could hold a referendum on the matter. Customs checks Customs checks would have to be put in place on trade between Northern and the Republic of Ireland. Most checks would be made using technology, but some would still have to be physical. Cash for Northern Ireland A promise of a 'new deal for Northern Ireland' means ministers putting money aside for Belfast and Dublin to help aide economic development and ensure new measures work. Keeping to the Good Friday agreement Freedom of movement between two countries will remain. New deal would confirm commitment to collobaration between UK and Ireland.  If the EU does offer an extension the PM will be legally obliged to accept it. It could get very messy indeed.  If the EU agrees to an extension will there then be a general election?  Yes, almost certainly. Opposition leaders including Jeremy Corbyn have said that they will agree to an early election if and when a No Deal Brexit has been ruled out.  If the EU offer a delay at the summit then MPs could vote the next week to trigger a snap poll.  There are two mechanisms for holding an early election. The first is for the PM to be defeated on a confidence motion, and two weeks to pass without another confidence vote being won.  The second - and more likely route – is to have two-thirds of the Commons vote for an early election. If that motion was passed on October 22, the campaign legally has to be at least 25 working days later.  Elections are traditionally held on a Thursday. That gives a potential date of November 28.  Could there still be a second referendum?  A general election looks more likely but there are plenty of MPs who want a second referendum instead.  Former Tory Sir Oliver Letwin has warned that an election would not be a satisfactory way of settling the Brexit debate, as it would be clouded by a host of other political issues.  Some senior Labour figures are also sympathetic to such concerns.  The route to a referendum would probably involve defeating Mr Johnson in a confidence vote, and then replacing him with a ‘unity’ candidate as PM such as Labour’s Margaret Beckett or ex-chancellor Ken Clarke. They would then push through the legislation for a referendum.  However, it looks like a very tricky proposition, with estimates that it could take up to six months to prepare a national ballot. There are also major questions about what the question would be, and whether No Deal would be on the ballot paper.  What happens if Boris Johnson wins a majority at the early election?  Downing Street has made clear that the PM is now planning to fight an election on a No Deal platform, as the EU will not compromise.  The pledge to make a 'clean break' is designed to absorb the votes that have flowed from the Tories, and indeed Labour in its northern heartlands, to the Brexit Party.  Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader pictured in London earlier this month, has said he will support an early general election if and when a No Deal Brexit has been ruled out  Victory could require a fundamental realignment of the country’s traditional political dividing lines, with the Conservatives needing seats like Bolsover – stronghold of hard-left veteran Dennis Skinner.  With a majority and a new mandate, Mr Johnson could then take the UK out of the EU without a deal – or have more leverage to extract concessions from Brussels.  What happens if Jeremy Corbyn wins a majority at the early election?  On current polling, Labour looks unlikely to secure a majority by itself. But the SNP has signalled it could prop him up, in return for permission to hold a new independence referendum.  Labour has vowed to renegotiate the existing Brexit deal and go into an election promising to hold a second Brexit referendum between a new divorce package and Remain.  What if there is another hung Parliament?  With the polls highly volatile, it looks quite possible that an election could deliver broadly similar numbers to the current Parliament.  This would be possibly the most disconcerting outcome for the country – sending politicians straight back to the drawing board to try and final a way to break the deadlock.",0
37,New poll shows Germans enjoying Brexit more than The Benny Hill Show,37," Germans enjoying Brexit more than Benny Hill Latest IPSOS polling indicates 79% of German nationals aged 18-34 are enjoying Brexit more than The Benny Hill Show, with a massive 94% preferring it to Mr Bean.  Respondent Sabrina from Munich (28) summed up the mood, telling pollsters, “We Germans really like any old British shit, the more broad and repetitive the better, but until now nothing had compared to Benny Hill.  “However, the mix of total nonsense, combined with utter stupidity, has really endeared Brexit to the average German. Even my Grandma is a fan!.”  However, Klaus from Dresden, 46, had this to say, “Maybe it’s my age, but Brexit can’t quite match the comedic genius of Benny Hill. It’s close, but let’s not get carried away.”  But he had some advice for the producers of Brexit hoping to get some new fans, “I think if they added some amusing music, and perhaps a woman or two in bikinis, then Brexit would do even better with a German audience.  “Maybe they’ll consider that for the next season. Though this one does seem to be lasting an awfully long time.”  The full breakdown of results are below:  Do you agree with this statement?

9,British campaigners have launched a fresh legal challenge to ensure the United Kingdom asks the European Union for a Brexit delay in the event Prime Minister Boris Johnson refuses to obey the law.,9," Tuesday's court action opened as Johnson, who insists the UK must leave the EU on October 31 with or without a deal, was accused of engaging in a ""stupid blame game"" by European Council President Donald Tusk.  Downing Street overnight claimed the EU had made a Brexit agreement ""impossible"", with an anonymous briefing to the conservative Spectator magazine insinuating the UK would seek to undermine the world's largest trading bloc if it were ""forced"" to remain a member by virtue of a deal not having been agreed.  ""[EU member nations] supporting delay will be seen by this government as hostile interference in domestic politics,"" the unnamed source told the magazine, edited by Johnson himself between 1999 and 2005.  It marked a change in rhetorical tone and provoked a furious response from Tusk, who accused the prime minister of jeopardising the future security of the EU and the UK.  191004195122213  ""Boris Johnson, what's at stake is not winning some stupid blame game,"" he wrote on Twitter.  ""At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people. You don't want a deal, you don't want an extension, you don't want to revoke, quo vadis?""  At the heart of Tuesday's political drama was an early morning phone call from German Chancellor Angela Merkel to Johnson, regarding the UK's suggestion to have two borders around Northern Ireland - turning the existing (invisible) border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member, into a formal customs border (albeit with physical checks and infrastructure some distance from the border itself), with a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, allowing Northern Ireland to remain in the EU's ""single market"".  ""Downing Street say Merkel said to Boris Johnson: 'Your plan is never gonna work',"" said Al Jazeera's Laurence Lee, reporting from London.  ""They say she said Northern Ireland has to stay in the customs union, in this trade bloc, to protect the integrity of an open Ireland - forever. Now that's entirely unacceptable to Downing Street, and they have been briefing that, effectively, it is dead - they're saying that there is no chance, if this is the EU's view, not only of a deal now, but of a deal ever.  ""It looks very much like they have started to reach the end of the road.""  Amid the dramatic escalation in the war of words between London and Brussels, there was apparent alarm among some UK ministers at the prospect the government could withdraw security cooperation with the EU if the bloc fails to offer a new divorce deal before October 19.  That is the deadline that has been set under contentious legislation passed in the Parliament of the UK with the assistance of a ""rebel alliance"" of Conservative MPs, at which point the prime minister is legally obliged to request a delay.  ""I am clear that any threat on withdrawing security co-operation with Ireland is unacceptable,"" said Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith.  Johnson faces 'Nob-Off' case  In Scotland, a fresh legal case was being heard on Tuesday under little-used ""Nobile Officium"" legislation - known as ""Nob-Off"" proceedings - in which petitioners are asking that a court send the Brexit delay request to the EU if Johnson refuses.  181213033234352  A similar court action failed on Monday, after the government last week provided legal assurances that it would comply with the law and make the request - despite statements to the media and on social media, including by Johnson himself, suggesting that they would not.  The court's ruling made it clear there would be very serious consequences for any government ministers or their lawyers who failed to comply with what they had told the court they would do.  If [Boris Johnson] doesn't [comply with the law], then we will face a genuine constitutional crisis and we will have to pick up the pieces then Jolyon Maugham QC  In the court in Edinburgh on Tuesday, the government argued that it had already undertaken to follow the law in its submissions to the case heard last week. Furthermore, the deadline had not yet been reached, and so it would be inappropriate for the court to pass judgment at this time.  Campaigners argue that leaving a court ruling until after October 19 would cause ""massive"" legal uncertainty; to wait until the deadline had passed would spark serious administrative and practical obstacles to enacting a legal remedy ahead of Britain crashing out of the EU by automatic operation of law on October 31.  But they admitted the court was likely to regard the government's promises as sufficient - ""for the moment"".  ""We will get a decision tomorrow,"" Jolyon Maugham, one of the senior lawyers bringing the case, told reporters outside the court.  ""My guess is that they're going to hold the matter over until October 21. I think they will want to see what actually happens before they get into this difficult territory. None of us want to have a prime minister who is facing contempt of court proceedings. I want the prime minister to comply with the law - and everybody should want the prime minister to comply with the law.  ""And if he complies with the law, there will be no need for any actions to be taken by the court or by anybody else on the 21st. But if he doesn't, then we will face a genuine constitutional crisis and we will have to pick up the pieces then.""  Analyst Michael Gray, who was watching proceedings at the court, tweeted: ""Essentially, petitioners are hopeful suspended Court of Session judgment could act as a 'Scottish backstop' to ensure the law is complied with & No Deal Brexit averted"".",0

16,The Latest on Brexit (all times local):,16," 5:30 p.m.  The European Parliament's chief Brexit official is warning proponents of a no-deal divorce in Britain that the thorny issues that have hobbled discussions won't miraculously go away.  Belgian MEP Guy Verhofstadt said issues about the future relationship between Britain and the European Union will remain and perhaps prove more intractable in a no-deal Brexit scenario.  He said that ""people were thinking in Britain: 'oh yeah, we can do a no-deal and then we go sitting around the table and we are going to talk about a future relationship and everything will be fine'.""  Verhofstadt said that would ""be nuts. No way.""  Britain is scheduled to leave the EU at the end of the month.  The EU has been consistent in saying that in a no-deal scenario, the questions over citizens' rights, Britain's divorce bill and the Irish border will need to be sorted out before discussions over the future trading relationship begins.  ———  11:50 a.m.  European Council President Donald Tusk has angrily addressed British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a tweet that Brexit is not ""some stupid blame game"" and directly asked him where he wants to take the fast deteriorating negotiations.  After Downing Street offered an extremely negative reaction to a phone call between Johnson and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Tusk quickly retorted that the EU-U.K. talks weren't about apportioning blame if the divorce turns out to be a chaotic and costly no-deal exit.  Tusk tweeted to Johnson: ""what's at stake is not winning some stupid blame game. At stake is the future of Europe and the UK.""  ———  10:15 a.m.  The British government says it still hopes to strike a Brexit deal with the European Union, despite mounting gloom on both sides of the Channel about the chances of success.  EU leaders have demanded more ""realism"" from Britain in response to a Brexit plan proposed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The bloc says the proposals don't fulfil the U.K.'s commitment to a frictionless border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.  French President Emmanuel Macron says the EU will assess by Friday whether a deal is possible.  The British government says the U.K. will leave on Oct. 31 with or without a divorce deal, and is taking steps to minimize the pain of a no-deal exit.

17,"Britain and the European Union traded ill-tempered barbs Tuesday as the U.K. said a Brexit deal might be impossible, while insisting it was still working for one with just over three weeks until its scheduled departure from the bloc.",17," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office said EU intransigence had led to a breakdown in negotiations, prompting a top European leader to warn against playing a ""stupid blame game"" — and chide Johnson in Latin.  Johnson's office gave a gloomy assessment after his call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday morning.  In a statement to British media, Downing Street said Merkel had told Johnson that ""a deal is overwhelmingly unlikely"" unless the U.K. agreed to let Northern Ireland continue to follow EU customs rules in order to maintain an open border with EU member Ireland.  That is something the British government says it can't accept. Downing Street said that ""if this represents a new established position, then it means a deal is essentially impossible not just now but ever."" How people and goods will move across the Irish border is the main sticking point to a deal.  The German government confirmed that Merkel and Johnson had spoken but declined to comment on the substance of ""confidential conversations.""  European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said ""the EU position has not changed. We want a deal. We are working for a deal with the U.K.""  European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted testily that ""what's at stake is not winning some stupid blame game.""  ""At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people,"" he said, addressing Johnson. ""You don't want a deal, you don't want an extension, you don't want to revoke, quo vadis?"" — a Latin phrase meaning ""where are you going?""  Despite the grim mood music, British officials insisted they still hope to strike a deal before Britain's scheduled Oct. 31 departure date — although Johnson has also said the U.K. will leave even if one is not struck.  ""We've moved — it is now time for the EU to move too,"" said Michael Gove, the minister in charge of Brexit preparations. ""If it does, then there is still every chance we can leave with a new deal.""  Downing Street said Johnson spoke by phone to Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar on Tuesday afternoon, and ""both sides strongly reiterated their desire to reach a Brexit deal."" It said the two leaders hoped to meet in person later in the week.  EU leaders have demanded more ""realism"" from Britain in response to a Brexit plan proposed by Johnson. The bloc says the proposals — which would require customs checks on some goods moving between Northern Ireland and Ireland — don't fulfill the U.K.'s commitment to a frictionless Irish border.  An open border is key to both the regional economy and the peace agreement that ended 30 years of conflict between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland is part of the U.K. but shares an island — and a land border — with the Republic of Ireland.  ""It's not just about trade, it's about so much more than that, and anybody who understands Ireland and the politics of this island understands that,"" said Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney.  French President Emmanuel Macron has said the EU will assess by Friday whether a deal is possible.  Johnson's opponents in Britain accused the government of deliberately undermining the Brexit talks.  ""Boris Johnson will never take responsibility for his own failure to put forward a credible deal. His strategy from day one has been for a no-deal Brexit,"" said Keir Starmer, Brexit spokesman for the main opposition Labour Party.  On Tuesday, Britain published more details of its plans for leaving without a divorce deal. The government says those plans will minimize any resulting economic shock.  Economists and business groups warn that no amount of preparation can eliminate the pain of new barriers with the EU, which accounts for almost half of U.K. trade.  The government's ""no-deal readiness report"" shows significant British preparation but also acknowledges its limits. Britain says it will try to keep goods flowing by not immediately imposing border checks on imports from the EU. But the government acknowledges there will be new tariffs on 60% of British exports to the EU, including levies of more than 50% on beef and lamb.  Many in the EU — and in Britain — are skeptical that Britain will leave the bloc on Oct. 31 because the U.K. Parliament has passed a law compelling the government to ask the EU for a delay to Brexit if no deal is agreed upon by Oct. 19.  Johnson says he will obey the law but will not ask for a delay. It's not clear how those two statements can be reconciled — but it's clear Johnson wants to pin the blame for any delay on Parliament and the EU, so that he can campaign as a champion of Brexit in an election that's likely to be called soon.  Both the government and the opposition see a national vote as the only way to break Britain's Brexit deadlock, though they disagree on the timing.  Parliament is set to be suspended Tuesday evening so that a new session can begin next week with a major policy speech from Johnson's Conservative government.  An earlier attempt by the government to shut down Parliament for five weeks was ruled illegal by Britain's Supreme Court because it had the effect of preventing legislators from scrutinizing the government's Brexit plans. This week's shorter suspension is more routine. Lawmakers will return on Monday.  ———  Casert reported from Brussels.

23,John Prescott to thump an MP every hour on the hour until Brexit gets sorted,23," John Prescott to sort Brexit Westminster has taken to emergency measures.  The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, took up his emergency hammer this morning and advanced to a glass panel which read “in case of utter fuck-up, break glass to release Lord John Prescott”.  “Big John immediately came out swinging. The speaker had to duck out the way,” confirmed journalist, Simon Williams.  “Then he immediately went right after Jacob Rees-Mogg and thumped him right in the back of the head. It was quite something. The lanky sod was laid out cold.  “Then he spotted Boris Johnson and yelled ‘come ‘ere you big, blonde bastard’ and gave chase across Parliament square, before catching up to him and setting to work with his fists.  “Michael Gove made the mistake of trying to intervene. They found his glasses a MILE away, which is more than can be said for his teeth. Heh heh.”  Lord Prescott commented “RAHHHHHH!  “Get this fuckery sorted out or everyone’s for the fist! YES ANDREA LEADSOME EVEN YOU, SWEETHEART, DON’T TEST ME.”",1
8,Prime Minister Boris Johnson has no choice but to request for Brexit to be delayed for a third time at the end of October.,8," Hopes of a deal with the European Union before the Brexit deadline have evaporated.  This means that Johnson must either resign as prime minister or request a delay by October 19 under the terms of a law enacted last month.  Everything we know suggests he will accept another delay rather than hand over the keys to Downing Street.  Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.  Later this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will write to the European Union requesting a delay to Brexit beyond October 31.  We know this for two incontrovertible reasons.  1. UK law compels him to request a Brexit delay  Last month, members of Parliament passed a piece of legislation known as the Benn Act, designed to compel the prime minister to seek an extension to the October 31 Brexit deadline if he failed to agree to a deal with the EU by October 19.  That date is less than two weeks away, and there is so far very little sign of either the EU or the UK getting anywhere close to a deal.  Read more: The scandals that could force Boris Johnson to resign as prime minister  Johnson's latest proposals have been dismissed by the Irish government, other European leaders, and multiple senior EU figures in Brussels.  A senior UK government source said on Tuesday that a deal with the EU is now ""impossible.""  So if there's no deal by October 19, the provisions of the Benn Act will kick in.  Under its terms, Johnson must write a letter to the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, requesting a delay until 11 p.m. GMT on January 31.  Thanks to the act, we even know what the letter will say:  Dear Mr President,  The UK Parliament has passed the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019. Its provisions now require Her Majesty's Government to seek an extension of the period provided under Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty, currently due to expire at 11.00pm GMT on 31 October 2019, until 11.00pm GMT on 31 January 2020.  I am writing therefore to inform the European Council that the United Kingdom is seeking a further extension to the period provided under Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty. The United Kingdom proposes that this period should end at 11.00pm GMT on 31 January 2020. If the parties are able to ratify before this date, the Government proposes that the period should be terminated early.  Yours sincerely,  Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland  In recent weeks, the British press has carried multiple briefings from anonymous UK government sources suggesting that Johnson will somehow get out of sending this letter or find some other means of sabotaging it. However, there is zero evidence to suggest that he can or will.  Indeed, far from committing to breaking the law, everything Johnson and his government have said on the record suggests that he will comply with it.  2. Johnson has already said he will send the letter  In recent days, Johnson has insisted on Twitter that there will be ""no delay"" to Brexit, and anonymous sources in the government have continued to insist that a delay will somehow be averted.  However, there is a very simple and obvious reason these briefings are made anonymously: They just aren't true.  As Johnson's own government lawyers acknowledged in a submission to a Scottish court last week, if no deal is reached by October 19, he will have no choice but to send the letter.  Read more: Boris Johnson told to resign following Supreme Court defeat and become the 'shortest-serving prime minister ever'  Johnson's lawyers said the prime minister would comply with the act and write to Tusk. A Scottish court on Monday also confirmed that it fully expects the prime minister to follow the law.  Of course, the prime minister could still break both his word and the law and refuse to request a delay. However, even if he did attempt this, the UK Supreme Court would inevitably intervene to ensure that he complied with his legal responsibilities.  There is also still a chance that the EU will refuse an extension. However, everything that the Irish government and other EU leaders have said in recent weeks suggests that this is unlikely. If Britain does end up leaving the EU without a deal, European leaders want that decision to be one taken wholly by the UK.  Johnson must either delay Brexit or resign  European Council President Donald Tusk and Johnson. Getty  Johnson has insisted that he would ""rather be dead in a ditch"" than delay Brexit and that there are ""no circumstances"" under which he would request a delay.  However, when push comes to shove, everything we know about the law and what Johnson's own legal team has said he will do suggests that next week he will break this pledge and request that Britain's exit from the EU is delayed for a third time at the end of October.  The only other alternative would be for him to resign as prime minister and allow Jeremy Corbyn or whoever else is able to form a caretaker administration to step in and delay it for him.  Read more: Boris Johnson could soon be forced to stand down as prime minister to make way for Jeremy Corbyn  As things stand, that looks unlikely.  Instead, Johnson is much more likely to cling on and hope that he can blame his opponents for any delay before going into a general election with the aim of winning a new majority in the UK Parliament.  The latter, ultimately, is the prime minister's main priority, and all the spin coming out of Downing Street to the contrary says a lot more about Johnson's attempts to spread the blame for a Brexit delay than it does about any serious attempt to prevent it.",0
14,"Open this photo in gallery Britain is set to leave the EU on Oct. 31, although Parliament recently passed a law requiring Prime Minister Boris Johnson to seek a three-month extension if he hasn’t reached an agreement by Oct. 19. Frank Augstein/The Associated Press",14," Brexit talks between Britain and the European Union are on the verge of collapse, with the two sides trading blame only weeks before the U.K. is set to leave the bloc.  The talks hit a roadblock Tuesday when British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. According to British officials, Ms. Merkel objected to Mr. Johnson’s proposals and “made clear a deal is overwhelmingly unlikely.” The officials added that if Ms. Merkel’s concerns “represent a new established position, then it means a deal is essentially impossible, not just now but ever.” A spokesman for Ms. Merkel declined to comment, but European Council President Donald Tusk accused Britain of engaging in a “stupid blame game.”  The breakdown in negotiations comes at a critical moment. Both sides have indicated that unless the framework of a deal is in place by the end of this week, the talks would end. Britain is set to leave the EU on Oct. 31, although Parliament recently passed a law requiring Mr. Johnson to seek a three-month extension if he hasn’t reached an agreement by Oct. 19. However, the Prime Minister has said repeatedly that he will find a way around the law and won’t seek an extension.  Story continues below advertisement  On Tuesday Mr. Johnson’s office and several cabinet ministers blamed the EU for the impasse, suggesting the bloc wasn’t serious about negotiating or giving ground. “We in this government have compromised,” Deputy Prime Minister Michael Gove told the House of Commons. ""We have moved. It is now time for the EU to move too.”  On a day of escalating rhetoric over Brexit, European Council chief Donald Tusk has warned British Prime Minister Boris Johnson not to indulge in a 'stupid blame game' over any breakdown in talks. Julian Satterthwaite reports. Reuters  But EU officials said Mr. Johnson’s proposals failed to address some of the bloc’s long-held concerns. “Boris Johnson, what’s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game,” Mr. Tusk tweeted. ""At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people. You don’t want a deal, you don’t want an extension, you don’t want to revoke, quo vadis [where are you going]?”  German MP Norbert Rottgen, who chairs the Bundestag’s foreign affairs committee, added on Twitter: “Frankly a deal on the basis of Johnson’s proposal … has been unrealistic from the beginning and yet the EU has been willing to engage. Blaming others for the current situation is not fair play!”  The main concern for the EU is Mr. Johnson’s proposal to pull the entire United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, out of the bloc’s customs union, which allows for the tariff-free movement of goods among members but requires them to set the same external duties. The EU has balked at the idea because it would mean customs checks along the Irish border, something the EU and Ireland believe violates the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which ended decades of sectarian violence and guaranteed an open border. The EU has insisted that Northern Ireland must remain in the customs union to ensure the border stays open. Mr. Johnson wants the entire country out so the U.K. can set its own tariffs and trade policy. Both sides indicated Tuesday that talks will continue, but it’s unclear how the impasse can be overcome.  As the discussions dragged on there was more evidence the prolonged Brexit debate is having a detrimental impact on the British economy. Figures released Tuesday by the Office for National Statistics showed that productivity – which measures economic output per hour worked – fell at the fastest annual pace in five years in the third quarter of 2019. And that came after zero growth in each of the previous two quarters. “These figures hammer home the impact uncertainty is having on the business environment,” said Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors.  Compounding the woes for business, the Treasury Department released a report Tuesday that said companies will have to file an additional 215 million customs declarations annually once the U.K. leaves the EU. And the cost of filing those declarations will be £7.5-billion, the report said. The figure represents “the administrative burden of completing customs declarations for all EU trade in goods movements.”  Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

12,Reuters,12," The pound tanked 0.7% against the euro on Tuesday morning, after reports that Boris Johnson's Brexit talks with Angela Merkel hit a dead end.  British media outlets are reporting, citing a source close to the prime minister, that ""the call with Merkel showed the EU has adopted a new position. She made clear a deal is overwhelmingly unlikely and she thinks the EU has a veto on us leaving the customs union.""  Britain is due to leave the EU on October 31.  Watch the pound trade live here.  View Markets Insider's homepage for more stories.  The pound tanked on Tuesday morning, after a senior UK government source claimed that the German chancellor Angela Merkel has told British Prime Minister Boris Johnson that there is now almost no chance of the EU agreeing to a Brexit deal with the UK.  The pound fell 0.7% against the euro, and 0.4% against the dollar.  Sam Coates, deputy political editor at Sky News, was among British reporters citing an anonymous briefing by one of Johnson's aides saying that ""the call with Merkel showed the EU has adopted a new position. She made clear a deal is overwhelmingly unlikely and she thinks the EU has a veto on us leaving the customs union.""  Coates added that the source said, ""Merkel said that if Germany wanted to leave the EU they can do it no problem but the UK cannot leave without leaving Northern Ireland behind in a customs union and in full alignment forever.""  The border between Ireland and Northern Ireland has been a major sticking point in Brexit negotiations, given this would be the only land border between the UK and the EU.  The source added that the chancellor said Ireland should have a veto on Northern Ireland leaving the customs union.  ""If this represents a new established position, then it means a deal is essentially impossible, not just now, but ever,"" the source added.  Following the news, Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, accused the British Prime Minister of playing a ""stupid blame game.  ""@BorisJohnson, what's at stake is not winning some stupid blame game. At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people.

19,"LONDON/BRUSSELS,19,The European Union accused Britain of playing a ""stupid blame game"" over Brexit on Tuesday after a Downing Street source said a deal was essentially impossible because German Chancellor Angela Merkel had made unacceptable demands.With just 23 days before the United Kingdom is due to leave the bloc, the future of Brexit remains deeply uncertain as both London and Brussels positioned themselves to avoid blame for a delay or a disorderly no-deal Brexit.In a sign that Johnson's last-ditch proposals to bridge the Brexit impasse have failed, a Downing Street source said Merkel and Johnson spoke on Tuesday morning and she made clear that a deal was ""overwhelmingly unlikely"".The Downing Street source said that if Merkel's position on Northern Ireland remaining in the EU's customs union was the bloc's position, then a deal was impossible.""If this represents a new established position then it means a deal is essentially impossible not just now but ever,"" the Downing Street source said.A spokesman for the German chancellor confirmed the call had taken place but declined to comment further.The EU was scathing.""Boris Johnson, what's at stake is not winning some stupid blame game,"" European Council President Tusk said on Twitter. ""At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people. You don't want a deal, you don't want an extension, you don't want to revoke, quo vadis?""Such abrupt remarks indicate the Brexit blame game has begun in earnest, and that now both London and European capitals are preparing for an acrimonious and potentially chaotic Brexit for which neither side wants to be held responsible.Johnson's spokesman said the British leader and Merkel had had a frank exchange and Britain had not seen any compromise from the EU. He said talks were at the critical point and it was not Britain talking about blame games.A disorderly Brexit could rip apart the United Kingdom, endager the peace in Northern Ireland, hurt global growth and shape the future of the European Union which was built on the World War Two ruins of Europe.The pound was down 0.5% at $1.2226.An array of remarks by unidentified British sources laid bare just how far apart the two sides are after three years of tortuous haggling over the first departure of a sovereign state from the EU.Brexit talks are now reaching a critical moment, a British spokesman said in Brussels where Johnson's Brexit negotiator David Frost was in meetings with EU officials.But Ireland braced for the worst with a no-deal Brexit budget while Britain announced its no-deal tarrif plan and updated on it preparations for a no-deal exit - the nightmare scenario for many big businesses.According to a Downing Street source, Merkel said that for a deal, Northern Ireland would have to stay in the EU's customs union and full alignment with the EU forever - demands Johnson could never accept or push through parliament.Arlene Foster, the leader of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party that supports Johnson's government, accused the EU and Ireland of trying to trap the British province in a permanent customs union.A separate Downing Street source told Reuters that unless the European Union compromises and does a Brexit deal shortly, then the United Kingdom will leave without a deal.""If the EU doesn't do a deal shortly, then we leave without a deal,"" the source said. ""We are leaving the European Union.""The opposition Labour Party said Johnson was trying to apportion blame ahead of a no-deal Brexit.""This is yet another cynical attempt by Number 10 to sabotage the negotiations,"" said Keir Starmer, Brexit spokesman for the Labour Party. ""His strategy from day one has been for a no-deal Brexit.""Johnson has consistently said the United Kingdom will leave the EU on Oct. 31 with or without a deal, though a law passed by parliament demands he write a letter to the EU asking for a delay if he cannot strike an exit deal by Oct. 19.He has said he would abide by the law but Britain would leave the EU by the end of the month, without explaining that contradiction. He has also repeatedly demanded an election but parliament has refused to grant one.Scotland's top court will rule on Wednesday whether to order Johnson to abide by the law forcing a delay and if it could sign a letter asking for an exension if he refuses to do so himself.The Spectator magazine quoted an unidentified source in Downing Street as saying that Britain would take an aggressive stance towards the EU if Brexit talks break down, possibly even by withholding security cooperation.""This government will not negotiate further so any delay would be totally pointless,"" the source was quoted as saying. ""We'll either leave with no deal on 31 October or there will be an election and then we will leave with no deal.""",0
10,"Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures — and in these Brexit times, extraordinary words among leaders.",10," Some British officials have previously compared the European Union to Nazis and Soviets, and EU Council President Donald Tusk said there was ""a special place in hell"" for some Brexiteers.  Tuesday saw the latest chapter in vitriolic invective among two sides claiming they want the most loving split-up ever, but too often display fits of pique in what is heading for a fighting, flaming divorce that bodes ill for future cooperation between neighbors.  With negotiations on the U.K.'s departure terms from the EU hanging precariously in the balance at a time when silence seemed golden, both sides broke the spell Tuesday.  In a tweet dripping with anger, Tusk directly addressed Johnson at his twitter handle @BorisJohnson and gave him his fill about the fast crumbling Brexit negotiations:  ""You don't want a deal, you don't want an extension, you don't want to revoke, quo vadis?"" — Latin for ""where are you heading?"" and a reminder of a less harsh era of diplomacy.  It was a rhetorical question anyhow, since Tusk had already analyzed recent British behavior when it came to Brexit and decided that Johnson mainly wanted to head for the EU's exit door as soon as possible and pile all the blame for fraught negotiations heading toward failure onto Tusk and the EU.  ""What's at stake is not winning some stupid blame game,"" Tusk told Johnson. If it is still mild by the standards of the other Donald, U.S. President Donald Trump, it immediately set European media alight.  What raised his ire was a London anonymous government debrief which said that the EU was now ""willing to torpedo the Good Friday Agreement,"" which has kept the peace on the island of Ireland for the past two decade, and claimed that EU made sure that ""a deal is essentially impossible.""  Those two elements have been anathema to EU and German thinking so far and both denied it. At EU headquarters it was seen as a ploy to simply blame the 27 remaining member states for whatever goes wrong before the official breakup.  The German government said it never comments on such confidential telephone conversations between leaders and insisted it was still looking for a deal to avoid the chaotic exit.  That is now set for Oct. 31 if there is no last-minute turnaround for a deal. The deadline could still be extended.  The inflammatory view by the British government of the German stance immediately fired up passions.  Arlene Foster, the leader of the DUP Northern Irish party aligned to Johnson, said that the idea her region would stay in an EU customs union was ""beyond crazy. No. U.K. government could ever concede such a surrender.""  Johnson also likes to use the word surrender, as if the UK and EU were at war, calling Parliament's anti no-deal bill the ""surrender act.""  If not real war, it has turned into a war of words — which is nothing new for the British prime minister.  After all, Johnson once compared Brexit to Allied prisoners escaping German prison camps in ""some sort of World War II movie."" And he already compared the EU's aims to those of Adolf Hitler, arguing the bloc was trying to create a super state that mirrored the Nazi leader's attempts to dominate the European continent.  And only last year, then foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt likened the EU to the totalitarian Soviet Union.  Tuesday was not the first time Tusk was pushed to the brink by Brexiteers.  ""I have been wondering what a special place in hell looks like for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of plan how to carry it out safely,"" Tusk said early this year.  Tusk, Merkel and Johnson are slated to spend a long summit meeting together next week to decide on the fate of the Brexit negotiations. There will be plenty to talk about.  ———  Jill Lawless contributed to this report from London.  ———  Follow AP's full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit",0

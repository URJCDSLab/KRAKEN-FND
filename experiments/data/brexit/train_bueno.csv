0,"Sterling fell on Thursday for a second straight day to near 10-day lows, as investors waited for parliament’s next step to break the Brexit impasse and opposition leaders gathered to discuss tactics.",0," The European Union’s Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said Britain had yet to provide “legal and operational” proposals for an agreement on exiting the bloc at the October 31st deadline .  The UK Supreme Court dealt Prime Minister Boris Johnson a blow on Tuesday when it ruled he had unlawfully suspended parliament. The ruling reinforced belief that Britain was unlikely to leave the EU without a deal on October 31st, but parliament remains split, early elections look inevitable and Johnson remains adamant  Those fears eliminated all sterling’s gains since the Supreme Court ruling, for its biggest one-day fall against the dollar in two weeks. By 0815 GMT, it had slipped 0.14 per cent to $1.2332. It was down 0.1 per cent against the euro at 88.66 pence  “We don’t know where things will go with Brexit. That’s being manifested in sterling more than any other asset,” said Fahad Kamal, chief market strategist at Kleinwort Hambros.  “What we have done in the face of unknowable political outcomes and daily volatility is to make sure our portfolios can deal with any big moves, big rallies or big falls,” he added.  Implied volatility gauges in sterling/dollar – a measure of expected swings in a currency – rose. They had fallen after the court ruling  Chartists see the next big support level for sterling around $1.2280 – the 50-day moving average, a technical indicator that refers to the currency’s average closing price over the past 50 days.  British opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will meet other opposition leaders later in the day, as they discuss how to stop Johnson from quitting the EU on October 31st if he fails to secure a deal with Brussels by October 19th. – Reuters",0
63,"Government denies that Brexit proposal titled ‘F*ck You, Eurotrash’ was designed to fail",63,"Boris Johnson EU deal Boris Johnson’s team have reacted furiously to a suggestion by Michel Barnier that the UK’s proposals were obviously designed to blame the EU for No Deal as it contained no workable solution to the Irish border question but over 400 insults directed at each European nation.  The EU claimed that having the foul-smelling document, delivered late by a sullen teenager and addressed to Frogface Barmier, was a calculated move to ensure rejection, and allow Boris Johnson to claim any No Deal fallout was the EU’s fault. Something categorically denied by Simon Williams MP, a junior minister for DexEU.  He explained, “We made our proposals in good faith and were never seeking to insult that assorted bunch of workshy wine drinkers that would all be German speakers if it weren’t for us.  “It is possible that there might have been a few cases of auto-corrected typos that changed perfectly sensible offers on cross-border veterinary certificates to words like Vespa riding whop or humourless kraut boxhead. But frankly, that is to be expected when things are done in urgency just as it is normal for legal documents to have a few faecal smears on them.”  Mr Williams also denied that Brexit policy was now only done with a view to capture the far-right vote and soothe ERG eurosceptics such as himself.  “If those unwashed eurocrats want to pretend to be offended then that’s nothing to do with us.  “As for me, I do not like the EU but I love Europe. That’s why I have a lovely vineyard and converted windmill in the Bordeaux area where my wife has claimed permanent residence.  “I’m even watching ‘Allo ‘Allo! to learn their bizarre donkey-braying language.”",1
58,Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption The purported UK plan involves cross-border customs checks and a regulatory border in the Irish Sea,58," Sources within the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) have told the BBC they are pleased with Boris Johnson's new Brexit proposal to replace the Irish backstop.  The Daily Telegraph earlier claimed the plan involves ""two borders"" until 2025.  It reported an Irish Sea ""regulatory border"" and customs checks between the Republic and Northern Ireland.  Addressing his party conference on Wednesday, the PM ruled out ""checks at or near the border"".  He also said the proposal would ""protect the existing regulatory arrangements"".  The unconfirmed newspaper report in the Daily Telegraph also said the proposed four-year time limit would give the Northern Ireland Assembly a vote in 2025 on whether or not to extend the arrangement.  In his speech to the Conservative Party conference, Mr Johnson described his plan as a ""compromise for both sides"" which would ""protect the union"".  ""We will under no circumstances have checks at or near the border in Northern Ireland,"" the prime minister said.  ""And by a process of renewable democratic consent by the executive and assembly of Northern Ireland we will go further and protect the existing regulatory arrangements for farmers and other businesses on both sides of the border.  ""And at the same time we will allow the UK - whole and entire - to withdraw from the EU, with control of our own trade policy from the start.""  'Unionist veto'  Before the conference, BBC News NI's political editor, Mark Devenport, sought reaction to the newspaper claims of the UK's purported ""final offer"" to the European Union.  ""DUP sources appear happy and content with the proposal because they say the backstop was anti-democratic; gave Northern Ireland no say,"" said our political editor.  ""But under the Boris Johnson offer, the Northern Ireland Assembly could choose to stay with this EU regulation, or move towards [regulatory alignment with] Great Britain in 2025.  ""And the way that voting would operate in the Northern Ireland Assembly is that unionists, if they didn't like the road that Northern Ireland was going down, would be able to veto that and move towards Great Britain.""  However, the Irish government has consistently rejected previous proposals that have involved customs checks on the island of Ireland or a time-limited backstop.  'All speculation'  When unconfirmed reports of the UK's proposals emerged late on Tuesday night, Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney said he had not seen the details but he, again, rejected the idea of a time limit.  ""So the rumour mill this evening is suggesting that there would be a four-year time limit and then a choice to be made by Northern Ireland at the end of that period, but again that's all speculation,"" Mr Coveney told Virgin Media's The Tonight Show on Tuesday.  ""Our position has been very clear on a time-limited backstop. If it's time-limited, and you can't answer the question what happens at the end of that time period, then it's not a backstop at all.""  Mr Coveney added that if the reports were true, then ""it doesn't look like it's the basis for an agreement, that's for sure"".  The Daily Telegraph reported that the UK plan ""effectively means that Northern Ireland will remain in large parts of the EU single market until at least 2025 - but will leave the EU customs union alongside the rest of the UK"".  The paper added that the proposals are likely to face ""fierce opposition from EU leaders who will be asked to grant the UK sweeping exemptions from EU customs rules to facilitate a Northern Irish customs border"".  'Strangle economy'  The leader of Northern Ireland's Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) Colum Eastwood said Mr Johnson's reported offer to the EU ""doubles down on his hard border plan"".  ""A regulatory border in the Irish Sea and a customs border across this island will strangle the local economy and runs contrary to the interests of communities and businesses here.""  On the basis of the report, Mr Eastwood has called on the leaders of the UK's biggest parties to vote Mr Johnson out of office.  ""I have written to the leaders of the Labour Party, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats at Westminster today asking them to take part in an unprecedented act of political selflessness to stop this chaos and protect the fragile interests of Northern Ireland,"" the SDLP leader said.  ""They must come together, pass a motion of no confidence in Johnson and unite behind a common candidate as a temporary measure to extend the Article 50 period.""  Alliance leader and MEP Naomi Long said: ""This proposal is in many ways the worst of both worlds, as we've gone from having no new borders to having two.  ""There is no respect for the particular complexities of Northern Ireland, our interdependent economy and society, and the Good Friday Agreement.""",0
3,Furious Labour MPs have demanded Boris Johnson apologise after he said the 'best way to honour the memory' of Jo Cox is for Parliament to 'get Brexit done' as John Bercow condemned the 'toxic' House of Commons.,3," The Prime Minister had also claimed the 'best way' for MPs to stay 'properly safe' is for them to help him deliver the UK's departure from the European Union on October 31.  Mr Johnson made the comments during a fiery clash in the Commons last night as numerous MPs urged him to tone down his Brexit rhetoric as they suggested it was putting their lives at risk.  This morning Mr Bercow pleaded with MPs on all sides to calm down as he said the atmosphere in the Commons was 'worse than any I've known in my 22 years in the House'.  Meanwhile, Brendan Cox, Jo's widower, said he felt 'a bit sick' after hearing Mr Johnson's remarks and today he was asked how he believed his late wife might have responded.  He said: 'She would have tried to take a generosity of spirit to it and thought about how in this moment you can step back from this growing inferno of rhetoric.'  MPs today launched a bid to force the PM to apologise as they demanded - and were granted - an urgent question in the Commons on his remarks.  But Mr Johnson snubbed the request for him to face a grilling as he sent junior Cabinet Office minister Kevin Foster to answer questions on his behalf.  Mr Johnson chose instead to attend a private meeting of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbench MPs in Parliament.  Despite his absence, Labour MP Jess Phillips led calls for the PM to say sorry as she accused him of 'putting words in my mouth and in the mouth of my dead friend'.  Rachel Johnson, the PM's sister, said her brother's remarks were 'tasteless'.  Last night's debate in the Commons had exploded into acrimony after Mr Johnson appeared to dismiss MPs' safety concerns as 'humbug' as he repeatedly referred to an anti-No Deal law passed by Parliament earlier this month as the 'Surrender Act'.  Opposition MPs responded to Mr Johnson's comments by claiming he has 'no moral compass of any kind' as they claimed he is 'totally unfit for office'.  Members of Mr Johnson's Cabinet also hit out at the remarks as Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan said politicians needed to remember their words had an impact and Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said everyone must be 'mild in our language'.  But James Cleverly, the chairman of the Conservative Party, defended the PM and suggested he had nothing to apologise for.  Boris Johnson, pictured in Downing Street today, responded to concerns about the safety of MPs in the Commons last night by saying 'humbug'  Mr Johnson was told by numerous MPs that they feared for their safety as they urged him to moderate his language  Members of the Cabinet expressed disquiet at what Mr Johnson had said in the Commons  Labour MP Ms Cox was murdered by a far-right terrorist two weeks before the EU referendum in 2016.  MPs tried to drag Mr Johnson to the Commons today to answer questions about what he had said yesterday evening.  Mr Bercow granted an application for an urgent question from Ms Phillips to ask the PM to 'reflect on his language' but Mr Johnson did not attend.  Ms Phillips asked the PM's stand-in Mr Foster to tell him to 'apologise and to tell him that the bravest, strongest thing to say is sorry'.  'It will make him look good, it will not upset the people who want Brexit in this country if he acts for once like a statesman,' she said.  Ms Phillips continued: 'Calling me names, putting words in my mouth and in the mouth of my dead friend makes me cross and angry, it makes me scared even, but I will not react, the Prime Minister wants me to react so I join in the chaos that keeps this hatred and fear on our streets.  John Bercow calls for calm as he urges MPs to 'lower the decibel level' John Bercow pleaded with MPs on all sides to calm down this morning as the fallout continued from Boris Johnson's combative performance in the House of Commons last night. The Commons Speaker said the House 'did itself no credit' in the angry exchanges which followed the Prime Minister's statement on Wednesday night. As MPs returned to the Commons today, Mr Bercow said: 'There was an atmosphere in the chamber worse than any I've known in my 22 years in the House. 'On both sides passions were inflamed, angry words uttered, the culture was toxic.' He told them to 'lower the decibel level and to try to treat each other as opponents, not as enemies'.  'I simply ask the minister... who's notable by his bravery today, I ask him to ask the Prime Minister to meet with me in private with his advisers and some of his colleagues, and my friends from Jo's family so we can explain our grief and try to make him understand why it is so abhorrent that he has chosen a strategy to divide rather than to lead.'  Mr Foster said that 'ultimately it is for everyone to think about what they say and how they have contributed'.  Some Tories have pushed back at the fury expressed by Labour MPs.  Steve Baker, the chairman of the European Research Group of Tory MPs, said: ‘What Boris Johnson has said is entirely defensible and reasonable, but the hypocrisy that is going on here is absolutely rank.  ‘I am a person who has sat through now, over nine years of debates in the House of Commons and in particular opposition day debates and the sheer hysteria and provocation, the pejorative language used by Labour MPs, throughout those opposition day debates, has been a cause of, frankly, despair to me.  ‘I have been insulted, injured, really driven to the depths of sorrow over what they have said, quite unreasonably.'  But Mr Johnson's sister said the remarks made by the PM were 'tasteless' and that repeated references to the 'Surrender Act' were 'highly reprehensible'.  'I think it was a very tasteless way of referring to the memory of a murdered MP,' she told Sky News.  Mr Johnson addressed the Commons last night after Parliament resumed following the Supreme Court's bombshell ruling that his prorogation was unlawful.  There were angry clashes from the start as Mr Johnson refused to apologise for suspending Parliament as he maintained his position that while he respected the court's ruling he disagreed with it.  Anger levels then spiked after Labour MP Paula Sheriff said the PM 'should be absolutely ashamed of himself' over his Brexit rhetoric as she pointed to Ms Cox's commemorative shield which is on the wall in the Commons chamber.  Ms Sheriff said: 'We stand here under the shield of our departed friend. Many of us in this place are subject to death threats and abuse every single day.  'Let me tell the Prime Minister that they often quote his words—Surrender Act, betrayal, traitor—and I, for one, am sick of it.'  She told the PM politicians 'must moderate our language' but he replied: 'I have to say that I have never heard such humbug in all my life.'  He also said the 'best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox, and indeed to bring this country together, would be, I think, to get Brexit done'  And responding to concerns about MPs' safety, he said: 'Believe me: the best way to ensure that every parliamentarian is properly safe and to dial down the current anxiety in this country is to get Brexit done. I hope that he will support us.'  Mr Johnson's comments prompted howls of anger as a number of MPs walked out of the chamber.  Ms Phillips had tweeted last night: 'I'm not scared of an election, I am scared I might be hurt or killed.'  Meanwhile, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson attacked the PM and said that she had just had to report a 'threat against my child' to the police as she said 'we must be able to find a way to conduct ourselves better'.  But the PM's combative performance prompted applause and a standing ovation from many Tory MPs.  Dominic Grieve, the former Tory MP who was stripped of the whip after backing a bid to block a No Deal Brexit, said he found the standing ovation given to Mr Johnson 'terrifying'.  John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, today called for calm as he said last night's debate was the most 'toxic' he could remember  Remainer MPs split over how best to take on Boris Johnson Remainer MPs are at loggerheads over whether they should try to strengthen an anti-No Deal law designed to force Boris Johnson to delay Brexit. Under the so-called Benn Act passed at the start of the month Mr Johnson will have to go to Brussels on October 19 and beg for a three-month Article 50 extension if he has not agreed an exit deal with the EU by then. But with the PM insisting Brexit will still happen on Halloween, with or without a deal, Remainers fear he is preparing to break the law. Some are worried that the current legislation to force his hand might may not be strong enough and want to make it 'bulletproof'. The Lib Dems are leading the charge and want to bring forward new rebel legislation which would force the PM to ask for a delay long before the middle of October - perhaps as early as next week. But 21 ex-Tory MPs who were stripped of the party whip after backing the bid to block No Deal are against tampering with the existing law.  He told ITV: 'I find it terrifying actually. This is somebody who is a pathological liar, one can watch him do it in the chamber of the House of Commons.  'I agree with Jess [Phillips]. He has no moral compass of any kind at all and it was quite deliberate, what he was saying was 'you do as I say and you won't be subject to death threats'.  'That was the impact of that comment. It is total populism.'  Ms Morgan also expressed discontent at Mr Johnson's remarks as she tweeted: 'I know the PM is aware of & sympathetic about the threats far too many of us have received because I shared with him recently the threats I am getting.  'But at a time of strong feelings we all need to remind ourselves of the effect of everything we say on those watching us.'  Mr Rees-Mogg told the Commons after the PM's statement: 'What has happened to other Members, particularly on social media, has been deeply unpleasant and troubling.  'We all have a responsibility to be mild in our language when we are speaking in this House or outside.'  In an unexpected move the Equality and Human Rights Commission weighed into the row this afternoon.  David Isaac, the chairman of the watchdog, said: 'Words have consequences and after the referendum we wrote to all political parties reminding them of the need for respectful debate at all times - no matter how difficult the issues.  'Sadly this has not happened. I urge all our politicians to show the best version of themselves so all views are heard.  'Hard line rhetoric and gestures only serve to create a more polarised society and will not heal the divisions that exist in our country.'  Mr Cox told ITV's Good Morning programme today that the 'tone of our politics is descending into the gutter'.  Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly, pictured arriving in Downing Street this morning, has defended Mr Johnson. Dominic Cummings, pictured heading into Number 10 today, has been accused of plotting a 'People versus Parliament' election campaign  Jo Cox's widower Brendan said he felt 'a bit sick' after Johnson claimed the best way to honour his murdered wife would be to 'get Brexit done'  Kim Leadbeater, Jo Cox's sister, told Sky News this morning that she had been left 'dumbstruck' as she watched last night's debate in the House of Commons  He said: 'It was one of those moments where you're shocked. I have to say I didn't expect Jo's name to be used in that way. It made me feel sick.'  He urged MPs to 'remember what Jo always said which is we do have more in common than that which divides us'.  Ms Cox's sister, Kim Leadbeater, told Sky News that she had been left 'dumbstruck' as she watched the Commons clashes.  'I think the PM needs to think very carefully about the language he uses,' she said.  Mr Cleverly defended Mr Johnson's comments as he denied that the PM labelled Opposition MPs 'traitors'.  'The accusations thrown at him yesterday were deeply unfair,' he said.  'He was accused of calling people traitors - he has never done that.'  Mr Cleverly admitted that Mr Johnson had used the word 'betray' during yesterday's debate.  Diane Abbott, shadow home secretary, said the performance by the Prime Minister in the Commons had put off MPs from offering cross-party support to a Brexit deal.  'I have spoken to people who might want to consider a Boris Johnson deal but that is over,' she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  ",0
48,Boris Johnson is preparing to make his final Brexit offer to the European Union.,48," However, a leaked version of the offer suggests that it will be almost immediately rejected by Brussels.  The key elements of the proposed deal appear to be impossible for the EU and Ireland to accept.  This suggests Johnson is deliberately setting up his offer to be rejected.  Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.  Boris Johnson will on Wednesday make his formal offer to the European Union for a new Brexit deal.  The offer, the key elements of which have been leaked to the Daily Telegraph's Peter Foster, is quite remarkable in that it appears to actually be designed for the EU to reject it.  In summary Johnson's offer is that:  Northern Ireland temporarily remains aligned to EU trade rules for some agricultural and industrial goods.  But Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK leaves the customs union.  New checks will be imposed at two borders (between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and along the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.)  Northern Ireland will be exempt from EU VAT rules and custom codes.  After four years Northern Ireland will have the option of cutting off alignment with the EU.  Every element of the plan runs against the EU's negotiating red lines.  From the very start of this process, Brussels and Dublin have insisted that there must be no new border checks with Northern Ireland. This is a commitment that the UK government signed up when led by Theresa May.  The EU has also been clear that the integrity of the European Single Market must be maintained and that there must be no get-out clauses for the UK a few years down the line.  All of those red lines are broken by this offer.  According to the Telegraph report, Johnson's chief of staff Dominic Cummings told senior aides that ""if they reject our offer, that's it.""  Yet Cummings and Johnson must know that this will be rejected. Indeed it is hard to come to any conclusion other than that rejection is precisely what these proposals are designed to achieve.  An offer the EU will have to refuse  The Godfather Getty  Johnson was asked earlier this year by the Daily Mail what his favourite movie scene was and he replied that it was ""the multiple retribution killings at the end of 'The Godfather'.""  However, there was another scene from the film which better explains the situation Johnson has engineered.  Early in the movie, Michael Corleone explains how his father Vito once persuaded a bandleader to hire his godson by telling him that ""either his brains or his signature would be on the contract.""  Johnson's offer today appears to have the complete opposite intent. Rather than being an ""offer they can't refuse,"" this is an offer the EU will have no choice but to refuse.  So what is the UK playing at and where will this end up? There are two distinct possibilities.  1. Bouncing the EU into a no-deal Brexit  Boris Johnson and Jean-Claude Juncker Getty Johnson's government has a majority of minus 43 in the UK parliament. Even if by some miracle, the EU was to agree to these proposals, he has zero chance of getting it passed by members of Parliament.  That would appear to suggest that the UK is inevitably heading for a no-deal scenario on October 31.  However, earlier this month MPs passed a new law which would compel Johnson to request a fresh Brexit delay if no deal has been secured by October 19.  This would be a nightmare scenario for the prime minister given his repeated insistence that there is ""no circumstances"" under which he would allow Brexit to be delayed.  But Downing Street understands that while the so-called Benn act will compel them to request a new extension to Article 50, it does not compel EU leaders to accept one.  By making such an unreasonable offer to the EU, Johnson could be hoping to bounce Brussels into rejecting any further delay. After all, what is the point for the EU of delaying Brexit for a third time when the UK government appears totally unwilling to agree to any of their demands for a deal after another delay?  So is this what Downing Street is attempting? It may be, but there is another possibility.  2. Setting up the EU to take the blame for a Brexit delay  Conservative Party Conference in Manchester Getty Whatever the claims from Johnson that he is determined to leave the EU on October 31 ""do or die,"" his government has not made enough serious preparation for the UK to leave the EU without a deal at the end of October. Anyone who has travelled through Britain's ports in recent weeks will have looked in vain for the massive new infrastructure required to cope with the new checks required for a no-deal scenario. And while many businesses are stockpiling for the possibility of their supplies being held up at ports, as Business Insider revealed earlier this year, there is nowhere near the sort of warehousing space required to seriously prepare for a no-deal exit and no time at all to create it.  Read more: No-deal Brexit stockpiling panic as British businesses warn warehouses are already booked up for Christmas  That means that a no-deal Brexit would be a disastrous outcome, not just for the UK economy, but for the government which chose to put the country through it. For this reason it remains difficult to believe that this is seriously the outcome that either Johnson, or the EU, will ultimately go for.  Whatever the briefings to the contrary, another Brexit delay therefore remains the most likely outcome at the end of October, which means that the main priority for Downing Street now is to prepare the ground for who will get the blame for it.  In the past week, Johnson's team has spent a lot of effort seeking to push most of that blame onto the UK parliament, with friendly newspapers briefed with the suggestion that British MPs are engaged in ""foreign collusion"" with the EU in order to frustrate Brexit.  Taken in that context, today's offer appears to have a similar design. By offering something that will be impossible for the EU to accept, the UK can then blame the EU for rejecting it, while avoiding getting dragged into lengthy negotiations which in themselves would require an agreement to delay Brexit.  Of course none of this amounts to a real attempt to, in the words of the Conservative Party's conference slogan this week, ""get Brexit done."" At best it is yet another attempt to put off the difficult choices that Brexit requires and at worst it is a reckless strategy that risks a disastrous outcome for the UK economy.",0
52,Image copyright AFP,52," Boris Johnson has outlined his plan to the European Union (EU) to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit.  Mr Johnson said the plan ""removes the so-called backstop"".  The backstop is the insurance policy negotiated by Theresa May and the EU. It is designed to avoid any physical border infrastructure, which it is feared would bring back memories of the Troubles, after Brexit.  It would keep the UK in the same customs territory as the EU, and Northern Ireland closely tied to EU regulations - until the UK and the EU reach a trade deal.  But it would stop the UK striking its own trade deals, which is why so many Conservative MPs, including Mr Johnson, oppose the backstop.  So, what is his alternative?  Customs union  The government wants the UK to leave the EU customs union. This would mean Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland ending up in two different customs territories.  This means lorries entering the Republic of Ireland from Northern Ireland will need to complete customs declarations. This is to ensure the correct tariffs (tax on imports) are paid when UK goods enter the EU customs union.  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics.  Reality Check's Chris Morris: From the beginning the EU has struggled to see how Ireland and Northern Ireland can exist in different customs territories while keeping the border as open as it is now under all circumstances. They will argue that - in the absence of a future free trade deal - this proposal means the UK is breaking commitments it has made about the border. The UK counters that the backstop has already been rejected in Parliament three times, and something needs to change.  Customs checks  Instead of installing customs posts and other physical infrastructure at the Irish border, the UK says declarations should be done electronically.  The government says physical checks would still be needed ""on a very small proportion of movements"". Currently, about one in 100 consignments entering the EU customs union are inspected to check that the goods match the information on the declaration.  These inspections could be carried out at warehouses or ""designated locations, which could be located anywhere in Ireland or Northern Ireland.""  The government's proposal does not spell out what these ""designated locations"" would look like, but it adds there should be ""a firm commitment (by both parties) never to conduct checks at the border in future"".  If adopted, a border solution relying on technology and remote checks would be a first. The EU does not currently share a single border with a non-EU country where checks have been completely eliminated.  That includes Norway (not in the EU) and Sweden (an EU member) - which share one of the most technologically advanced borders in the world. Their main crossing point processes about 1,300 lorries a day, with each waiting 20 minutes on average.  The EU has previously rejected a customs solution that relies on technology.  Back in January, Sabine Weyand, the EU's director-general for trade, said: ""We looked at every border on this Earth, every border the EU has with a third country - there's simply no way you can do away with checks and controls.""  The government says that some small traders should be exempt from paying duty. However, the document does not address smuggling head on. In other words, what will be done to detect and prevent traders, who should be paying duty, from crossing the border without completing custom declarations first?  Reality Check's Chris Morris: The EU will see much of this as a rehash of previous ideas that it doesn't think will work. And many people will worry that unspecified ""designated locations"" could become targets for anyone seeking to undermine the Northern Ireland peace process. The EU will push back hard against suggestions that it needs to revise its own customs rules to suit the UK.  Regulations on goods  When it comes to the regulation of goods, Northern Ireland would keep to the rules of the EU's single market, rather than UK rules.  That removes the need for product standard and safety checks on goods at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, because both will be part of an ""all-island regulatory zone"".  But it creates the need for checks between the rest of the UK - which will not be sticking to EU single market rules - and Northern Ireland..  All agricultural, food or animal products entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK will have to go through a Border Inspection Post. That's a bit of infrastructure where goods can be physically examined and paperwork checked.  Manufactured goods in Northern Ireland would also have to keep to EU rules, and these goods would be checked ""at the boundary of the zone"" - presumably at crossings between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, on the Irish Sea.  Reality Check's Chris Morris: This is quite a big concession from the UK side - basically accepting that there would have to be quite intrusive checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK for a number of years, on things like product standards and food safety. The EU has always said there have to be checks carried out somewhere, and both sides will try to deny any suggestion that this amounts to a new border in the Irish Sea.  Stormont's say  Having Northern Ireland following EU rules for the production of goods over which it has no say is, as the document says, ""a significant democratic problem"".  As a result, it is proposed that the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive will have to sign off on the plan before it takes effect.  The Northern Irish institutions will be asked to approve the plan again every four years, and if they do not then Northern Ireland would stop following EU rules one year later.  The Northern Ireland Assembly has not met since early 2017.  Reality Check's Chris Morris: The issue of democratic legitimacy is a crucial one, but it cannot be applied unevenly. The EU is likely to have a problem with anything which suggests that only Northern Ireland could have - in effect - a veto on this plan. The point of the backstop was to provide a legal guarantee to keep an open border under all circumstances. Being subject to approval every four years simply isn't the same thing. If Northern Ireland voted to leave this arrangement things like checks on food safety would have to take place at the Irish border.  What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

16,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption ""I want to ask the prime minister to apologise"" - Labour MP Jess Phillips",16," The prime minister has been urged to apologise after he said the best way to honour Jo Cox, the MP murdered during the EU referendum campaign, was to ""get Brexit done"".  Boris Johnson was also criticised for calling the law aimed at blocking a no-deal Brexit the ""surrender bill"".  Labour MP Jess Phillips said the ""bravest"" thing for the prime minister to do would be to apologise.  But Tory chairman James Cleverly called criticism of the PM ""deeply unfair"".  During an ill-tempered debate on Wednesday, Mr Johnson was repeatedly challenged by opposition MPs over his use of the term ""surrender bill"" to describe legislation passed earlier this month, which aims to block a no-deal Brexit on 31 October if he fails to come up with a new exit deal with the EU before 19 October.  He dismissed one MP's intervention, in which she both criticised his use of language and mentioned the killing of Ms Cox, as ""humbug"".  Ms Cox, who supported Remain during the referendum campaign, died in 2016 after she was shot and stabbed in Birstall, West Yorkshire.  Her husband Brendan Cox told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had been shocked by the language used in the Commons on Wednesday, saying Brexit debate had become a ""bear pit of polarisation"".  ""I'm not sure that we can look the nation in the eye and say that was a good day.""  That's how a Conservative MP has described the torrid scenes in the Commons in the last 24 hours.  Outrage is a common currency these days, but MPs' jaws dropped as Mr Johnson ramped up the rhetoric in responses to questions - suggesting first that it was ""humbug"" for a Labour MP to demand he temper his language, to try to protect MPs' safety.  Then, he went on to say that the appropriate legacy for the MP who was murdered during the referendum, Jo Cox, was for MPs to complete the Brexit process.  No surprise that Labour MPs howled in protest, some left the Commons in disbelief.  And there may be few Tory MPs willing, as the day goes on, to defend how far he went.  Read Laura's blog in full.  Asking an urgent question in the Commons on Thursday, Ms Phillips said: ""The use of language yesterday and over the past few weeks such as the 'surrender bill', such as invoking the war, such as betrayal and treachery, it has clearly been tested, and workshopped and worked up and entirely designed to inflame hatred and division.""  She added: ""It is not sincere, it is totally planned, it is completely and utterly a strategy designed by somebody to harm and cause hatred in our country.""  Ms Phillips also said: ""When I hear of my friend Jo Cox's murder and the way that it has made me and my colleagues feel, and feel scared, described as humbug, I actually don't feel anger towards the prime minister, I feel pity for those of you who have to toe his line.""  The ""bravest and strongest thing"" for Mr Johnson to do would be to apologise, she added.  Fellow Labour MP Paula Sherriff said she accepted it was ""necessary for all us of to reflect"" on the issue.

A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The PM obviously made the broader point last night that he believes we need to get the issue of Brexit resolved because it was causing anxiety and ill-feeling in the country.""  He added that, whatever their views, politicians and those in public life ""shouldn't face threats or intimidation... it's completely unacceptable"".  BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said Downing Street was not planning to shift away from using the term ""surrender bill"".

69,"Lightweight, artificial object that’s bad for the environment has disposable coffee cup snatched away from it",69," Boris Johnson has coffee cup taken away from him A phoney substance that is only known for one thing and has proven to be bad for whatever environment it is left in has had a disposable coffee cup snatched away from its hands, it has emerged.  The incident, which was caught on camera behind the scenes at the Conservative Party Conference earlier today, saw an aide snatch a foam coffee cup from disposable basic Prime Minister, Boris Johnson.  “It’s unsustainable, bad for the environment, and with a lasting negative effect on society,” explained aide Karen Williams, “and that’s why it shouldn’t be allowed to drink any more coffee.  “It’s bad enough as it is, lumbering around causing chaos and sullying everything it touches, without having caffeine inside it making it ten times worse for everyone.”  Wringing her hands, she went on, “You thought your job was hard? I’ve got to make it seem like the Tory party care about the environment, but it’s a tough ask when we’ve got someone like Boris on the scene.  “He is a single-use Prime Minister who was brought in to get Brexit delivered and then to be discarded, but he can’t even get that right.  “At this rate we’re going to have to recycle Theresa May’s deal just to make it look like we’re trying.”",1

Now that it’s been absolutely months since the Avengers movies came to an end Marvel Studios has decided it’s time to start remaking them all with a clever twist.  “We want to make our superheroes relevant to the modern world,” said producer Simon Williams.  “When we started with the first Iron Man movie, Brexit wasn’t even a thing. People don’t go to the cinema to escape these thorny political issues – our audience wants us to tackle them head-on.  “Hence the latest gang of daft-looking wallies in positions of power – The Brexiters.”  Some casting details have been announced:  Boris Johnson will play The Hulk. Whenever he loses a parliamentary vote he becomes angry and turns into a hideous monster (to be played by Ann Widdecombe) shouting ‘Big Girl’s Blouse’ at random passersby.  Jacob Rees-Mogg will play Iron Lady Man. Wearing a Margaret Thatcher suit he flies around the UK creating unemployment and social inequality.  Nigel Farage will play Captain Britain. A weedy little twat created in a military laboratory, Captain Britain spends all his time reminiscing about the halcyon days of the Second World War – a better time when Brits were allowed to slag off the French and kill Germans. The Captain carries a Union Flag shield in order to protect himself from milkshakes.  Dominic Raab will play Thor.

45,The Latest on Brexit and British politics (all times local):,45," 7:10 p.m.  The European Parliament’s chief Brexit official said the British government’s new Brexit plan does not give Ireland sufficient guarantees.  European lawmakers need to approve any Brexit deal, and its top legislators assessed Wednesday’s new proposals from Britain with the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.  Afterward, Belgian MEP Guy Verhofstadt said “the first assessment of nearly every member in the Brexit Steering Group was not positive.”  He said the group would flesh out objections on Thursday.  The main sticking point between the EU and Britain has centered on the border on the island of Ireland. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has insisted that a previously agreed insurance measure to make sure no hard border emerges between EU member state Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K., is ditched.  The plan he’s sent over to Brussels ditches that so-called backstop agreement in favor of new customs arrangements.  ———  6:30 p.m.  The British government says it will ask Queen Elizabeth II to suspend Parliament for a few days next week ahead of a speech laying out the administration’s plans.  The move comes over a week after the U.K. Supreme Court ruled an earlier five-week shutdown of the legislature unlawful. In that case, the court said the suspension had the effect of frustrating Parliament’s ability to scrutinize the government’s Brexit plan.  The new proposal is likely to be far less controversial. The government wants Parliament to break from Tuesday evening until Monday, Oct, 14, when the government will launch a new session and a fresh legislative program with a Queen’s Speech.  A short suspension of that kind is routine and usually happens about once a year.  ———  6 p.m.  The European Union’s Brexit negotiator says that the Brexit proposals of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson constitute “progress” that finally opens up room for negotiations before the crucial EU summit in two weeks’ time.  Michel Barnier said though that the gap between both sides remains daunting and “to be frank lots of work still needs to be done” to meet the three key conditions of the EU.  The border on the island of Ireland remains the key sticking point and the EU is insistent it remains transparent and open, that any deal doesn’t hamper the seamless economic cooperation between the EU’s Ireland and the U.K.’s Northern Ireland and that any border deal respects the rules of the EU internal market.  Barnier said “we will continue to work, to work to reach a deal. The ‘no-deal’ will never be the choice of the EU, never.”  ———  5:30 p.m.  The European Union presidency says that the 27 member states are ready to look at British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s proposals “constructively.”  Finland, which currently holds the EU rotating presidency, said that the European Commission led by Jean-Claude Juncker will assess the proposals “and is ready to engage actively.”  The statement added that “the EU 27 will stay united” during the upcoming negotiations.  ———  5:05 p.m.  EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has welcomed British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s “determination” to advance Brexit talks and said negotiations on Johnson’s new withdrawal deal proposal would take place “over coming days.”  Despite a yawning gap between the two sides, the European Commission said Juncker “acknowledged the positive advances” in some of the proposals Johnson submitted on Wednesday.  At the same time, the commission said “the president noted that there are still some problematic points that will need further work in the coming days.”  If there is to be any divorce deal before the U.K. leaves the EU as scheduled on Oct. 31, both sides have said they would need to reach an agreement by the time an EU summit set for Oct. 17-18 EU summit ends.  Johnson said in his letter to Juncker that his proposals “provide a basis for rapid negotiations.” In his reply, Juncker has left the door open for a solution to be found that resolves remaining differences.  ———  3:20 p.m.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel says she can’t comment yet on the new Brexit proposals put forward by the U.K. government but is stressing the importance of the 27 remaining EU countries maintaining a united front.  Britain’s Brexit envoy was in Brussels Wednesday to deliver Prime Minister Boris Johnson's proposal for kick-starting negotiations on a divorce deal. Johnson said it represents a reasonable compromise for both the U.K. and the E.U.  Merkel said at a news conference in Berlin with visiting Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte: “We will look carefully at the proposals. I can’t say anything about them yet today.”  She added that “for us, it is very important that we as 27 (countries) stick together. We trust in (EU negotiator) Michel Barnier, and we will discuss it further.”  ———  3:15 p.m.  Britain has sent its proposals for a Brexit deal to leaders of the European Union, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson urging “rapid negotiations towards a solution.”  The proposals submitted on Wednesday focus on maintaining an open border between the U.K.’s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland - the key sticking point to a Brexit deal.  Johnsons says in a letter to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker that the U.K. proposes to do that by keeping Northern Ireland closely aligned to EU rules for trade in goods, possibly for an extended period.  He says not reaching a deal would be “a failure of statecraft for which we would all be responsible.”  ———  2:05 p.m.  British Brexit envoy David Frost has arrived at the European Union’s headquarters in Brussels to deliver Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s proposal for kick-starting stalled negotiations on a divorce deal.  Carrying a black leather portfolio, Frost did not speak to the media as he entered the Berlaymont Commission building.  The EU’s Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, plans to make a first assessment of the document to see if Johnson’s proposal is a basis for late-hour negotiations. Barnier then will take it to the European Parliament’s experts and the ambassadors of the 27 EU nations for further discussion.  EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker will also have a first look at the proposal that centers on how to manage the border on the island of Ireland. Juncker expects to have a telephone call with Johnson to discuss future talks.  ———  1:50 p.m.  The European Union has approved Brexit preparedness measures to soften the financial blow to workers in the bloc’s remaining countries in case Britain leaves in a chaotic and costly no-deal scenario.  Finnish Employment Minister Timo Harakka said Wednesday that “these measures will ensure that anyone who loses their job as a result of hard Brexit will not be let down.” Finland currently holds the rotating EU presidency.  The measures would allow such workers to get financial aid from a fund that helps EU citizens losing their jobs as “a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns.” A no-deal Brexit meets those standards for getting aid from the European Globalization Adjustment Fund.  No other financial details were immediately available.  Harakka said: “Solidarity is a core value of the EU, and we have to make sure that in the event of major economic disruption, nobody is left behind.""  ———  12:25 p.m.  The European Union says it will give any proposal from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson serious legal vetting before saying whether it is worthy of being a basis for future talks on the U.K.’s departure from the EU.  The European Commission said in a statement that “once received, we will examine [the UK text] objectively & in light of well-known criteria,” which includes whether it prevents a hard border on the island of Ireland, preserves cooperation between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and respects the EU rules on trade across borders.  European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is set to speak with Johnson in the afternoon and technical talks among both sides are also set up.  ———  11:55 a.m.  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says there will be ""grave consequences for trust in our democracy"" if Brexit is delayed beyond Oct. 31 and vows there will be no custom checks at the Northern Ireland border.  Britain narrowly voted in 2016 to leave the EU but remains deeply divided over the departure terms.  The comments came as Johnson described his offer for Brexit deal to the European Union on Wednesday, as the date for Britain's departure from the bloc looms.  Johnson insisted that “under no circumstances “would there be customs checks at the border in Northern Ireland under the proposed deal, one of the main sticking points of talks.  Johnson says the proposal is a ""constructive and reasonable compromise,"" but it's likely to face deep skepticism from EU leaders, who doubt the U.K. has a workable plan to avoid checks on goods or people crossing the border between EU member Ireland and the U.K.'s Northern Ireland after Brexit.  ———  8:05 a.m.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson will send what he says is the U.K.'s ""final offer"" for a Brexit deal to the European Union, with the date set for Britain's departure less than a month away.  Johnson says the proposal is a ""fair and reasonable compromise."" But it is likely to face skepticism from EU leaders, who doubt the U.K. has a workable plan to avoid border checks between EU member Ireland and the U.K.'s Northern Ireland.  The British government says it will send the proposals to Brussels after Johnson closes his Conservative Party's annual conference on Wednesday. Johnson says he'll walk away from talks if the EU refuses to ""engage"" with the U.K. plan.  Johnson insists Britain must leave the EU on Oct. 31, with or without a deal.  ———  Follow AP's full coverage of Brexit and British politics at: https://www.apnews.com/Brexit",0
34,Queen to avoid Brexit chaos by applying for German passport,34," Queen in Brexit clusterfuck t-shirt The Queen will be applying for a German passport in order to avoid the potentially harmful consequences of a ‘no-deal’ Brexit according to a Buckingham Palace spokesman.  Palace press attaché Brigadier Tarquin Ftang-Ftang Ponsonby-Psmythe (the second ‘P’ is silent) said that “As one knows, the Queen has German ancestry, which allows her to apply for a German passport so that she may remain an EU citizen.  “She is particularly concerned that a ‘no-deal’ Brexit will not allow her to park the royal yacht ‘HMS Yachty McYachtface’ at her favourite European watering holes such as St. Tropez and Rotterdam.  “By obtaining a German passport the Queen will be able to continue to holiday in style at the British tax-payers expense, without having to queue or apply for any visas.  Upon gaining German citizenship Her Majesty also intends to become Empress of Germany and march upon Britain to force the country back into the EU,” concluded the Brigadier, before adding, “The second ‘P’ is silent by the way. Don’t forget that bit.”  The Queen’s husband Prince Philip will at the same time be applying for a Greek passport thanks to his Greek ancestry, after which he intends to set up a kebab stall on Levkas.",1
57,"In his office in Derry, Gavin Killeen has the television on.",57," Like most business owners on the Border, he has spent the 3½ years since the Brexit referendum glued to the latest news and trying to divine what each fresh headline might mean for his company.  Killeen is the managing director of Nuprint Technologies which employs more than 40 people manufacturing and supplying labels and flexible packaging for the food and drink industry across Ireland. Their customers’ products are displayed on the wall behind him; they include Bushmills whiskey, Donegal Creameries and Lacpatrick Dairies.  As British prime minister Boris Johnson prepares to address the Conservative party conference, Killeen has a pen and paper ready, to take notes. The Border is only a mile away. All Killeen’s raw materials are imported from the EU and 35 per cent of his business is with the Republic of Ireland.  This matters – to his business, to his way of life – but he is not hopeful. “This is probably the realisation of the worst fears we’ve had over all these years about Brexit.”  Johnson begins to speak. “Let’s get Brexit done,” he says. Killeen repeats it, shaking his head. “Let’s get Brexit done? That’s the answer for everything.”  The British prime minister outlines his plans. “We will,” he says, “under no circumstances have checks at or near the Border in Northern Ireland”.  “We will respect the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement and by a process of renewable democratic consent by the Executive and Assembly of Northern Ireland, we will go further and protect the existing regulatory arrangements for farmers and businesses on both sides of the Border.”  This proposal, says Johnson, would allow the UK “whole and entire to withdraw from the EU”.  “It’s complete nonsense,” is Killeen’s initial reaction. “How can you have all of that on one side, and then have the UK withdraw as a whole on the other?”  Johnson continues. The proposals are a “compromise”, he says, but “if we fail to get an agreement because of what is essentially a technical discussion on the exact nature of future customs checks when that technology is improving the whole time, then let us be in no doubt . . . about the alternative – the alternative is no-deal”.  This is not an outcome the UK wants, he says, but “it is an outcome for which we are ready”.  “I think that [a no-deal Brexit] is the outcome he wants,” is Killeen’s response. “It’s the outcome he’s prepared for. He [Johnson] says all the things he doesn’t want to happen, but he doesn’t say how to avoid them. There are no solutions.  “Listen to the words, ‘there will not be checks on or near the Border’. Listen to the things he’s not saying – that means there will be checks, just removed from the Border. Or will there be random customs checks? What would be the consequences of that?”  The consequences of any such customs checks would be significant for the firm. There would be an increase in paperwork, potential delays, tariff charges to pay, and the collection of VAT at point of entry would create cash-flow problems for small businesses.  “Capital will find the part of least resistance,” explains Killeen. “Businesses will stop trading across the Border. We’ll turn our back on the Border, and we’ll try and grow our business by trading internally within the UK.”  Customs checks  He is concerned by the lack of clarity: “He’s said nothing concrete at all. It’s all bluster and bravado, with no substance. We’re not any clearer. All we know is ‘let’s get Brexit done’ is the strapline.”  According to plans outlined by Boris Johnson in a letter to European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, later on Wednesday, the North would become part of an all-island regulatory zone but would leave the customs union, which would necessitate customs checks.  The Northern Ireland Assembly would be given the power to approve the arrangements and to vote on them every four years. The plans have been supported by the DUP, but rejected by the North’s other four main parties.  Killeen’s belief is that the most likely outcome is a no-deal Brexit.  “You hope it won’t put you out of business, and you may have a few pretty fallow years, but you have to see what way it works. We have to try other things,” he says.  “There will be people that will try and capitalise on this and use it to their advantage to the detriment of society. And I think we do need our politicians and our business leaders to speak up and try and be a calming influence on what lies ahead, because it does look like it will be a very difficult, difficult period.”",0
56,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption DUP leader says new proposals ""sensible and serious""",56," The DUP has endorsed Boris Johnson's offer to the European Union.  It includes the creation of an all-island regulatory zone for agriculture, food and all manufactured goods.  DUP leader Arlene Foster said it was a serious and sensible way forward which ""allows the people of Northern Ireland a role which they didn't have"".  However, the Irish prime minister said the proposals ""do not fully meet the agreed objectives of the backstop"" - the mechanism they seek to replace.  After speaking with Boris Johnson on Wednesday evening, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar indicated ""he would study them in further detail and would consult with the EU institutions, including the Task Force and our EU partners"".  The two prime ministers agreed to talk again next week.  Assembly vote  The backstop, agreed in Theresa May's withdrawal agreement, is meant to keep a free-flowing border on the island of Ireland, but critics fear it could trap the UK in EU trading rules indefinitely.  The government plan, outlined in a seven-page document published on Wednesday, would see Northern Ireland stay in the European single market for goods, but leave the customs union - resulting in new customs checks.  The Northern Ireland Assembly would get to approve the arrangements first and vote every four years on keeping them.  Speaking in Belfast after returning from the Conservative Party conference Mrs Foster said it gives the people of Northern Ireland ""the consent that they didn't have in terms of the anti-democratic nature of the backstop"".  ""This is a serious and sensible way forward to have engagement with the European Union in a way that allows us all in the United Kingdom to leave the EU,"" she added.  Image copyright AFP/Getty  The UK proposal is that a revived Stormont Assembly and Executive would have to give their consent for the trade arrangements to come into force before the end of a transition period, which is due to last until 2021.  That consent would then have to be renewed every four years.  Under Assembly cross-community voting rules this would give both unionists and nationalists a veto over aligning with the EU.  If the Assembly withheld its consent, Northern Ireland would revert to the trade regulations which apply elsewhere in the UK.  If the arrangements are approved by the Assembly and Executive, Northern Ireland would adopt EU trade regulations.  However, under the UK proposal it would remain within the UK customs territory meaning there will be a requirement for some customs checks on goods moving across the border.  The European Commission said it will ""examine [the proposals] objectively"".  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The PM's offer includes an ""all-island regulatory zone"", meaning NI would follow EU rules for goods  In his speech to the Conservative Party conference on Wednesday, Mr Johnson described his plan as a ""compromise for both sides"" which would ""protect the union"".  His offer is for an ""all-island regulatory zone"", which would mean Northern Ireland would have to follow EU rules for goods.  There would be additional checks on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, but the UK would not apply further checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Ireland.  Checks relating to the single market are about product standards, to ensure goods comply with EU regulations.  However, Northern Ireland would leave the EU customs union with the rest of the UK, so there would have to be new customs checks between North and South.  Those checks would look at customs documents and the payment of tariffs, which allow goods to cross the border in the first place.  The government proposals suggest the vast majority of checks could be carried out electronically - but thinks a small number of physical checks would have to take place, either at business premises or at points on the supply chain.

He's pitting himself against lawmakers who are determined to avoid a no-deal exit, which economists say would disrupt trade with the EU and plunge the U.K. into recession.Opponents accuse the prime minister of fomenting violence and hatred with his populist, people-versus-politicians rhetoric.Some in Parliament warned Johnson to be more cautious, given the 2016 killing of legislator Jo Cox The Labour lawmaker was murdered a week before Britain's EU membership referendum by a far-right attacker shouting ""death to traitors.""Labour lawmaker Paula Sherriff brought up the death of Cox — and the death threats many legislators still face — and implored the prime minister to stop using ""pejorative"" language.There was uproar in the Commons after Johnson replied: ""I've never heard such humbug in all my life.""

But never to demonize the other side and always hold onto what we have in common,"" Cox tweeted.Wednesday's fiery session of Parliament came a day after Britain's Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Johnson's attempt to suspend Parliament for five weeks until Oct. 14 stymied its scrutiny of the government's Brexit policy.

23,Boris Johnson faces his greatest humiliation for a couple of hours,23," Boris Johnson It is understood that embattled Prime Minister Boris Johnson will face his greatest humiliation for a couple of hours or so when Parliament votes to take control of business later today.  It comes in the wake of having his prorogation of Parliament ruled illegal, his trousers falling down and taking a cream pie to the face.  Mr Johnson responded robustly to the prospect of ever-greater humiliation.  “If there is one thing my few short months as Prime Minister has taught me,” he said, shortly after loudly breaking wind whilst there was a pause in the conversation.  “It’s how to handle a constant and unrelenting stream of abject humiliation on both domestic and foreign stages.”  Pausing briefly to wipe off the pigeon excrement that had just landed in his hair, Mr Johnson waved to someone who he thought was waving at him but was actually waving at someone else, then got in his car which promptly let out a loud bang and cloud of smoke from the exhaust pipe before all four wheels fell off.

54,LONDON — Boris Johnson was accused of lying to the queen when he illegally suspended Parliament last month.,54," But that hasn’t scared him off coming back for a second shot.  This time, though, Parliament will be suspended for a much shorter period, ending its current session on the evening of Tuesday, Oct. 8, before resuming the following Monday.  The government says the move is necessary to deliver the Queen’s Speech — the traditional procedure marking the beginning of a new session of Parliament, in which the queen outlines the government’s legislative agenda for the new session.  Johnson, who became prime minister in July, was handed a humiliating smackdown by the country’s Supreme Court last month when it ruled his attempt to suspend Parliament for an extraordinary five weeks — taking it out of action for a critical period ahead of Britain’s scheduled departure from the EU on Oct. 31 — was politically motivated and unlawful. Parliament was then swiftly reinstated, but according to parliamentary procedures, the current session still needs to be brought to an end.  Johnson said at the time he would abide by the ruling, even though he strongly disagreed with it. The ruling prompted widespread calls for Johnson to resign for misleading the queen.  Read: Boris Johnson Must Know the EU Will Never Accept His Latest Brexit Pitch  In a statement, Downing Street said the suspension would be “for the shortest time possible” to allow the government to prepare for the state opening of Parliament.  Johnson said the Queen’s Speech would outline the government’s plans for domestic issues: the national health service, education, crime, and the economy.  “We will get Brexit done on Oct. 31 and continue delivering on these vital issues.”  The announcement came just hours after Britain delivered its final pitch to the EU for a last-minute Brexit deal. Johnson has said he hopes to secure a deal with EU leaders at a critical summit starting Oct. 17, but insists Britain will leave the bloc at the end of the month whether it has an agreement or not.

38,Moment of Brexit tenderness as adorable British MPs think Article 50 extension is up to them,38," Parliament so cute about article 50 In an endearing scene that melted hearts all over Europe, amusingly bossy British politicians stomped their feet and insisted that they would tell the EU to give an extension to Article 50 despite having less say on the matter than a part-time assistant to a Flemish regional minister.  MP Mark Francois, 53 and ½, was one of many in Westminster who spoke out about the deal while wearing a lovely blazer that made him look like a future heart breaker as long as he stops scoffing chocolate.  Although he voted against it, Mark was adamant Brussels would do as it was told.  “I got my own army uniform and every time we play war I’m the one who’s the chief. I’ll tell those boys in Brocksalls that they better give an extension or else. And Jacob said I could do it because Jacob is my friend and he also said I can come to his house and ride one of his ponies if I want. Do you collect pogs? I’ve got hundreds!”  Although the EU did not take an official stance, the Commissioner for Trade, Sigmiund Wilhelms said that the vote left many in EU capitals sighing and cooing.  He went on, “It’s so sweet they think it’s up to them. The truth is the Slovenian intern who works in Barnier’s office will have more impact on the decision to grant or refuse an extension. But weren’t they all so cute?  “Now run along, I’ve got to decide where the new Airbus factory is going.”",1
51,Boris Johnson reveals his proposed Brexit deal to the European Union.,51," The plan, the key elements of which were leaked on Wednesday, would require new checks on the island of Ireland and between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the plan has numerous ""problematic points"" but that the EU would continue negotiations with the UK in the coming days.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the plan was ""worse than Theresa May's deal.""  Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.  LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson has submitted his proposal for a new Brexit deal to the European Union, as time runs out for the United Kingdom to agree a new Brexit deal.  In a letter to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday afternoon, Johnson insisted that he ""wants a deal"" but warned that there is ""very little time"" left to secure one before the October 31 deadline.  The plan, key elements of which were leaked to The Telegraph newspaper on Tuesday, is designed to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit.  However, Johnson has admitted that it will inevitably create some new checks on goods moving in and out of Northern Ireland, which under his proposal would take place away from the Irish border.  It received a warm welcome from the Democratic Unionist Party, which props up Johnson's minority government, but has been dismissed as ""not serious"" by senior Irish politicians and questioned by a number of experts.  The prime minister discussed the proposals over phone calls with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, on Wednesday.  Juncker said he welcomed Johnson's ""determination"" to reach a revised Brexit deal but that there were ""still some problematic points that will need further work in the coming days.""  A spokesperson for Juncker said: ""President Juncker confirmed to Prime Minister Johnson that the Commission will now examine the legal text objectively, and in light of our well-known criteria.  ""The EU wants a deal. We remain united and ready to work 24/7 to make this happen – as we have been for over three years now.""  What has Johnson offered the EU?  In the plan, sent to Juncker on Wednesday, there would be two new borders after Brexit: a customs border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, and a regulatory border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  Read more: An offer they will have to refuse: Boris Johnson is trying to force the EU into rejecting a Brexit deal  This is because the Northern Ireland would leave the customs union with the rest of the UK but continue to follow swathes of European single market rules covering agricultural and industrial goods.  This temporary arrangement would kick in at the end of the transition period in December 2020, should politicians in Northern Ireland's democratic institutions — its government and parliament — vote in favour of it.  Northern Ireland's politicians would then vote every four years whether to continue following those EU single market rules, or instead cut regulatory ties with Brussels and converge with the rest of the UK.  Northern Ireland has not had a functioning government or parliament since January 2017 when a row between the two largest parties — the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein — caused the institutions to collapse.  Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn the proposal was ""worse than Theresa May's deal.""  He added: ""I can't see it getting the support that he thinks it will get and it will take us into a regime in Britain of deregulation, of undercutting and I think will also undermine the Good Friday Agreement.""  The PM is accused of a sham negotiation  The EU is expected to reject the proposals when they arrive in Brussels.  Numerous experts have said they are unviable, with Peter Foster, the journalist who first revealed them, describing them as ""extraordinary"" and adding: ""I cannot for the life of me see how this flies; or could ever be intended to fly.""  The plan falls short of upholding the commitment made by the UK government when it was led by Theresa May, to make sure there are no physical checks on the island of Ireland whatsoever as a result of Brexit.  Jonathan Powell, who represented the UK government in Northern Ireland peace talks, saidthe proposals were ""not serious"" and indicated that Johnson was actually trying to avoid an agreement with the EU so no deal takes place.  And Helen McEntee, the Irish government's Minister for European Affairs, said the proposals were ""unacceptable"" as they breached the UK government's previous commitment to avoid physical checks on the island of Ireland.

However, the prime minister has said he will not delay Brexit.  On Wednesday, he told Conservative party conference: ""We will work for a deal with our EU friends; but whatever happens we must come out by the end of October.""",0
14,"BRUSSELS - A damning UK Supreme Court ruling against British Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week has rekindled discussion within the European Union about another delay to Brexit, with the bloc drawing a line in the sand of mid-2020 at the latest.",14,"   The British parliament resumed on Wednesday after the court ruled that the chamber had been unlawfully suspended by Johnson, who insists he will take Britain out of the EU on Oct.31 - with or without a deal to manage the fallout.But British lawmakers reject the most damaging, no-deal Brexit and, back at work, will now have more chance to upset Johnson's plans.    With the divorce deal stalled, the EU is expecting another delay to Britain's departure date after it was already postponed twice from the original March deadline.    ""We are in favour of an extension if we also see what is the way forward, will there be a general election, a second referendum, will there be a Withdrawal Agreement,"" said Guy Verhofstadt, an EU lawmaker dealing with Brexit.    ""I think that there is unanimity...to say 'OK, let's go forward with an extension if there is a clear path to a solution and unwinding of the situation we have today',"" he told EU lawmakers on Wednesday afternoon.    With a national election expected in Britain by the end of the year, the bloc currently sees that as the most likely justification of anther lag - a decision that would require the unanimity of the 27 states staying on.    The problem is, however, that Britain would need to request such an extension, which Johnson vows never to do and EU Brexit watchers speculate about him possibly stepping aside to let someone else make the step.    Under the law, the EU could also formally demand a delay - which Britain would need to agree to for it to take effect.    But diplomats and officials dealing with Brexit in the bloc's hub Brussels ruled out such a possibility, saying it would risk feeding Johnson's rhetoric about distant elites trying to frustrate the will of the people.    SHORT OR LONG?    With many question marks over the fate of Brexit lingering three years since Britons voted out, EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Oct.17-18 will discuss the desirable length of any such delay.    The British prime minister will not be allowed in the room.    The House of Commons has passed a law demanding that London seeks a postponement until the end of January 2020 to avoid an abrupt split on Oct.31 should no new divorce deal be reached at the EU summit in three weeks time.    ""January may be a bit too soon for us,"" said one EU diplomat. ""It is far from clear that Britain would be able to sort itself out by then and we would risk another summit at the turn of the year to push back another no-deal prospect.""    ""A six-month delay until the end of March might be better for us,"" the person said under condition of anonimity.    Brexit weighs heavily on the EU's work on its next long-term budget from 2021 and several diplomats said there could be no more extensions beyond mid-2020, when the bloc needs to have clarity on whether Britain would go on paying.    ""It could be one long or two shorter ones. Regardless, the cut-off date is in the middle of next year because we need to be able to finalise our own budget in the second half of 2020 at the latest,"" said a senior EU diplomat.    A third diplomat stressed the message: ""We have no problems with extensions as long as they do not impede with us finalising the budget, which must happen in the second half of 2020.""    Another risk for granting Britain an extension next month is the more hawkish stance by French President Emmanuel Macron who, backed by the increasingly expasperated Belgian and Luxembourg leaders, has opposed granting the latest delay until Oct.31.    His camp stresses the cost of protracted uncertainty in terms of sapping the EU's political capital and attention needed to face challenges from climate to migration to international crises, as well as economic cost for companies who have invested in expensive contingency preparations for a no-deal Brexit.    ""This is a nightmare,"" Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel said at the top of his voice in an emotional speech this week that highlighted the EU's growing fatigue with the tortuous process. ""People would love to have clarity.""    Despite that, most EU diplomats and officials currently believe the bloc would grant Britain another Brexit lag - should London request it - to avoid taking the blame for disruptions expected in any no-deal split.    var cont = `Join Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

73,UK negotiator leaves threat of shitting himself on the table in order to secure Brexit deal,73," Brexit negotiations With Boris Johnson replacing Theresa May as UK PM, the dynamic of the Brexit negotiations have changed dramatically.  Since coming into the role of Brexit negotiator, David Frost (not that one) has refused to rule out shitting himself in order to force the EU into a favourable deal.  “It’s important that the EU understand I’m serious here,” said Mr Frost.  “I will not hesitate to shit in my own pants if they don’t make changes to the backstop.  “When you’re in a top-level negotiation like this, you never take anything off the table. I know that because I read it in my Negotiation for Dummies book.”  However, despite Mr Frost’s resolute attitude, the threat has only served to confuse the EU.  “I understand that Mr Frost will shit in his pants, yes,” explained EU negotiator Michel Barnier, who must have countless better things he could be doing.  “But, I don’t really understand why he thinks this is such a threat to the EU. They are, after all, his pants.  “Whilst the negotiation room will smell a bit, this is not a big problem for us, we open the window and the smell goes away, but for Mr Frost? His pants and trousers are all beshitted. He can try cleaning them, I suppose, but I would imagine they will be ruined beyond repair.”  Undeterred by the EU’s refusal to be cowed by his threat to shit himself, Mr Frost is prepared ramp up his threats.  “Alright, they’re not bothered if I shit myself? Fine,” he said.  “What about if I punch myself in my own face as well? That’ll show them.”",1
17,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks in the House of Commons, London, after judges at the Supreme Court ruled that his advice to the Queen to suspend Parliament for five weeks was unlawful. House of Commons - PA Images | PA Images | Getty Images",17," Frustrations over Brexit blew up into anger and tears in Parliament on Wednesday night as lawmakers first vented fury over the government's refusal to apologize for unlawful actions and then railed at Prime Minister Boris Johnson's language in relation to a murdered MP. The House of Commons – Britain's lower house of Parliament – resumed activities Wednesday after the U.K. Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the Conservative government had acted unlawfully to suspend its sitting. The country's Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, who had advised ministers that prorogation would be legal, stood up to reiterate the Conservative Party line that while they would respect the ruling, they did not agree with it.  Opposition MPs (members of parliament) were quickly on the attack — accusing Johnson and his colleagues of eroding democracy and failing to respect the judiciary's role within U.K. society. Addressing Parliament, Cox quickly dismissed any notion the government would be repentant, instead booming to the House that that opposition MP's were ""a disgrace"" for refusing to grant Johnson the snap election he craves. ""This parliament is a dead parliament. It should no longer sit, it has no moral right to sit on these green benches,"" added Cox. That prompted an opposition lawmaker, Labour's Barry Sheerman, to visibly shake and turn crimson as he raged that the U.K.'s attorney general — the crown and government's top lawyer — had ""no shame at all."" ""To come here with his barrister's bluster to obfuscate the truth - a man like him, a party like this and a leader like this to talk about morals and morality. It's a disgrace."" The poisonous atmosphere continued through the day as lawmakers continuously called on U.K. leader Boris Johnson to resign.  PM raises the temperature  Johnson arrived at the angry scene in the early evening to make a statement and take questions. Any possibility that he would reduce the tension quickly evaporated as he struck an indignant tone, repeatedly accused opposition benches of betrayal and ""surrender"" to Europe. The Prime Minister goaded opponents to call an election, waving his arms and shouting: ""come on, come on."" Parliament, Johnson said was ""refusing to deliver on the priorities of the people"" while Labour were ""determined to throw out the referendum result, whatever the cost."" ""We will not betray the people who sent us here,"" Johnson roared to huge cheers from his own benches and visible anger opposite.  In the bear pit atmosphere, opposition lawmaker Alison McGovern raised the case of Jo Cox — a Labour MP who was murdered in the days leading up to the 2016 Brexit referendum by a man who attacked her while yelling ""Britain first."" Johnson caused gasps and shouting by responding to McGovern that the best way to honor Cox's life was to deliver the Brexit vote. Then lawmaker Paula Sherriff then said she had received death threats from people who echoed the use of Johnson's language. The Prime Minister responded: ""I have never heard so much humbug in my life.""

68,"Government proposes Schrodingers Irish Border, which exists when you want sovereignty and doesn’t exist when you want frictionless trade",68," Boris and Schrodingers Irish Border The Irish border will exist in multiple uncertain states in which it both exists and doesn’t exist at the same time depending on what you want right this second, according to proposals unveiled today.  Two borders will coexist in a state of quantum superposition; one which prevents undesirables and European laws from crossing, and another which is highly permeable to cheap imports.  Despite seeming internally contradictory, the Department for Exiting the EU insist that quantum events have been observed at the Planck scale and can exist for a fraction of a second, so permanently applying it to the Irish border is no more ridiculous than anything else they’ve suggested.  The government expects the suggestion to be warmly received by the European Union, which similarly exists in two states at once depending on who is speaking; one where it is so weak it desperately needs British money and another where it is powerful enough to bully Britain.  “The border would exist in a theoretical state which is only resolved when you look at it,” a spokesman told us. “So if you’re driving a lorry load of car parts, for example, the border exists as a wave, as we wave you through.  “But if you’re a migrant fruit picker hoping to take a cash-in-hand job it resolves as a particle which has enough volume, density and mass as is required to stop you passing. Simple!  “Also, at high energy states, the Irish border can jump to a higher shell at Drogheda, whilst at lower energies it will manifest in the Irish sea.”  “What do Michael Gove and an electron have in common?” he added.  “They both interfere with themselves when nobody is looking.”",1
32,Man sent into furious tailspin by Extinction Rebellion adamant he will cope fine with No Deal Brexit,32," Man upset at extinction rebellion A red-faced man who has been apoplectic since his commute was slightly lengthened due to the actions of Extinction Rebellion sees no contradiction with his claims that he could shrug off any minor hardships brought about by a No Deal exit from the EU.  Simon Williams, a Docklands estate agent who lives in Croydon, has been incessantly railing about how being forced to reroute on Thursday morning was nothing less than a mortal threat to his ability to feed his family.  Paradoxically, Mr Williams has also been telling people around him that any disruption to transport, food chains, financial transactions or medical supplies due to the country engaging in a no-deal Brexit would be easily coped with, because his grandparents had survived the war.  He explained “These middle-class virtue signallers are taking food out of my children’s mouths by making me slightly late for work. We need to crack down on them before they bring the country to its knees.  “I’m all for the freedom to protest but how many times will they force me to leave my home slightly earlier than usual? It sounds harsh but I think we need to use the army.”  However, Mr Williams was much more phlegmatic when asked how he felt the UK should deal with Brexit.  He explained, “We should just go. No deal, no fuss. We’ll be fine. My Grandad was an anti-aircraft gunner in the War. He survived the Blitz and rationing which means I have too, in a way. We just need to rely on British pluck and that will see us through.”  Mr Williams then interrupted the interview to scream at a parcel delivery driver who had ‘ruined everything’ after leaving a package out in the rain.",1
1,brexit countdown_bg Created with Sketch.,1," Opposition leaders gathered in Parliament today to plot how to tie Boris Johnson's hands over Brexit.  Jeremy Corbyn joined Remainers Jo Swinson and Ian Blackford as well as the leaders of minor parties to discuss how they can ensure the Prime Minister obeys the law and seeks another Brexit delay.  Under the so-called Benn Act passed at the start of the month Mr Johnson will have to go to Brussels on October 19 and beg for a three-month Article 50 extension if he has not agreed an exit deal with the EU by then.  But with the PM insisting Brexit will still happen on Halloween, with or without a deal, Remainers fear he is preparing to break the law.  Some are worried that the current legislation to force his hand might may not be strong enough and want to make it 'bulletproof'.  A Lib Dem source said this afternoon's meeting was 'positive', while Labour said another meeting would take place on Monday, during the Conservative Party Conference.  Mr Corbyn pledged further parliamentary action to ensure Prime Minister Boris Johnson asks for an extension, as demanded by the Benn Act.  In an interview, the Labour leader said: 'It's not a matter of choice for him, it's an Act of Parliament that was passed. Last night he seemed unable to give that undertaking.  'We will be taking parliamentary action on this again next week to ensure that the Prime Minister does not crash us out of the EU on October 31 without a deal.'  The action would be to make demands on the PM to request the extension, but further discussions are to be held with the cross-party group on the specifics of the motions, he said.  Pressed on whether he would whip MPs to vote for an election the moment an extension is agreed, he said: 'Absolutely.'  Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, said yesterday that she wants to toughen up an anti-No Deal law to force the PM to seek a Brexit delay as soon as next week  Jeremy Corbyn pledged further parliamentary action to ensure Prime Minister Boris Johnson asks for an extension, saying: 'It's not a matter of choice for him'  The Lib Dems want to bring forward new rebel legislation which would force the PM to ask for a delay long before the middle of October - perhaps as early as next week.  But 21 ex-Tory MPs who were stripped of the party whip after backing the bid to block No Deal are said to be against tampering with the existing law.  Instead they want to use the time between now and the October 19 deadline to hold the Prime Minister's feet to the fire in different ways.  Brexit Minister James Duddridge told the Commons this morning that the government would abide by what is on the statute book but insisted Mr Johnson remains committed to taking the UK out of the bloc on October 31.  'We will obey the law, but who knows what will happen between now and then in the negotiations,' Mr Duddridge said.  But 21 ex-Tory MPs like Rory Stewart (above, on GMB yesterday) are believed to be opposed to tampering with the legislation  Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson yesterday said that the UK could not wait until October 19, when the Benn Act - named after creator Labour MP Hilary Benn - says the PM must have asked the EU for a three-month extension if a No Deal split looks likely.  She said that there were fears that legal efforts to compel the PM to act might take longer than the period between the October 19 deadline and the Brexit departure date on Halloween.  Addressing the media outside Parliament yesterday, Ms Swinson argued that a 12-day buffer was not enough to safeguard against No Deal.  'We would argue that 12 days is not sufficient, particularly in line with a Prime Minister who has shown he is prepared to disobey the law,' she said, standing in front of Lib Dem MPs and peers.  'Even with the Supreme Court judgment, he has talked about disagreeing with it as if a Supreme Court judgment is something you can pick and choose whether or not it is right.  'That is why we have to bring forward the ways in which we can make sure the No Deal threat is removed.'  But Ms Swinson's plan appears doomed to fail after Labour responded coolly to the idea of changing the Benn Act.  'A lot of thought went into picking the date and it is not yet clear what problem the Libs are trying to fix,' a Labour source told The Telegraph.  However, there is growing dismay among some Remain-backing Labour MPs over Jeremy Corbyn's Brexit leadership.  Jeremy Corbyn, pictured in the House of Commons last night, is believed to be against the idea of changing the so-called Benn Act  One Labour MP said: 'It's humiliating. There's no leadership whatsoever. As usual he's present, but not involved.'  Meanwhile, the 21 Tory MPs who were stripped of the whip are also believed to be opposed to Ms Swinson's proposals.  They reportedly favour leaving the anti-No Deal law as it is and concentrating instead on ramping up the scrutiny of the PM's Brexit plans.  It is thought the 21 former Tories want to use parliamentary procedures and arcane devices to force the government to publish more details of its No Deal contingency planning and to keep the pressure on the PM with urgent questions and debates.  Such methods have proved productive for rebel MPs in the past as they have previously forced the government to hand over Brexit economic impact assessments and No Deal documents.",0
2,Boris Johnson's divisive aide Dominic Cummings was confronted by a furious Labour shadow minister in Parliament today who accused him of masterminding the Prime Ministers role in a 'toxic' Commons confrontation.,2," Shadow transport minister Karl Turner made a beeline for the No 10 chief of staff when he saw him this afternoon, telling him 'people are blaming you' for last night's bruising encounter.  Brexiteer Mr Cummings has been heralded as encouraging a 'people versus Parliament' strategy to push through Brexit.  Labour wants the PM to apologise after he said the 'best way to honour the memory' of murdered MP Jo Cox is for Parliament to 'get Brexit done'.  He also claimed the 'best way' for MPs to stay 'properly safe' is for them to help him deliver the UK's departure from the European Union on October 31.  Mr Turner, the MP for Leave-voting Kingston-upon-Hull in Yorkshire, confronted the Tory aide in Portcullis House, part of the parliamentary estate.  The MP said 'I’ve had death threats overnight, should be dead', to which Mr Cummings, leaning on a post, coolly replied; 'Get Brexit done.'  Shadow transport minister Karl Turner made a beeline for the No 10 chief of staff when he saw him this afternoon  Mr Cummings responded by telling the shadow minister: 'I don’t know who you are'  This seemed to antagonise the Labour MP further, as he replied: 'It’s a disgrace.  'Get Brexit done? I’ve had three opportunities to get Brexit done. If I could have voted for it, I would have voted for it. Don’t tell me to get Brexit done.  'The Prime Minister should be there (Brussels) negotiating a deal to bring back for me to support.'  Labour wants the PM to apologise after he said the 'best way to honour the memory' of murdered MP Jo Cox is for Parliament to 'get Brexit done'  Mr Turner scolded the PM in the Commons on Wednesday for 'laughing and joking' and using 'aggressive language' towards MPs while they were questioning him about the decision to prorogue Parliament  118 Church of England archbishops and bishops condemns MPs 'unacceptable' language Every archbishop and bishop in the Church of England has condemned the language used by MPs as ‘unacceptable’. In a joint statement, the 118 members of the College of Bishops said: ‘In the last few days the use of language, both in debates and outside parliament, has been unacceptable. ‘We should speak to others with respect… We should not denigrate, patronise or ignore the honest views of fellow citizens but seek to respect their opinions, their participation in society, and their votes’. The bishops acknowledged they were ‘conscious of the great challenges MPs face’ but urged for ‘respect on all sides amid growing acrimony.’ The Archbishop of Canterbuty, the Most Rev Justin Welby, told The Times: ‘The foundations of our unity and way of life are being challenged. ‘There needs to be a cooling of tempers on all sides in order to enable people to try to come to an agreement to see what solution can unite the country and do what has to be done.’ This is not the first time the church has intervened on Brexit. In August this year, a group of 25 bishops wrote an open letter warning of the dangers of leaving the European Union without a deal. In it signatories, including the Bishop of London and the Bishop of Manchester, said: ‘Our main social and political priority must be to leave well, paying particular attention to the impact of political decisions on those most vulnerable.’  Mr Cummings responded by telling the shadow minister: 'I don’t know who you are.'  The Hull East MP had scolded the PM in the Commons on Wednesday for 'laughing and joking' and using 'aggressive language' towards MPs while they were questioning him about the decision to prorogue Parliament for five weeks, a move Supreme Court judges this week ruled unanimously to be unlawful.  He said threats then followed 'overnight' that 'caused me great stress'.  One person on the Facebook group Yellow Vest Hull said Mr Turner 'wants putting in a ditch', echoing the PM's phrase that he would rather be 'dead in a ditch' than ask the European Union for an Article 50 extension.  Another said they were tempted to 'pay a visit' to the MP, who represents a seat that voted 72 per cent to leave the EU.  Mr Turner later told PA Media he was 'truly worried' about his family's safety - he has a three year old daughter - having previously had a person arrive at his house in Hull to confront him.  Brexiteer Mr Cummings (pictured in Downing Street today) has been heralded as encouraging a 'people versus Parliament' strategy to push through Brexit  Mr Cummings, pictured at a book launch today, previously goaded Jeremy Corbyn when he saw him in Parliament earlier this month  As they passed eachother in Westminster, Mr Cummings told the Labour leader: 'Come on Jeremy, let's do this election, don't be scared'  'The reason I was provoked into making an impassioned plea for him to stop allowing the tone of the debate to be as it is, is because I am truly worried about my family,' he said.  'I've had previous experiences of attacks on the house and the family and you can't decide when you see these threats whether it is a serious death threat or whether it is just someone firing off at the keyboard when they've had too much to drink. I don't know and it worries me.'  It is not the first time Mr Cummings, who was the chief strategist for the Vote Leave campaign, has interacted with an MP.  Earlier this month, he is said to have goaded Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, shouting: 'Come on Jeremy, let's do this election, don't be scared' as they passed each other in Westminster.",0
30,Crack team of Brexiters to annex Ireland and rename it West Hampshire,30," group of business people A crack team of Brexiters have decided to take radical action to eliminate difficulties surrounding the backstop by annexing Ireland and renaming it West Hampshire.  Frustrated by the Government ignoring a perfectly reasonable petition to invite Ireland to rejoin the United Kingdom, the Brexiters set their plan in motion.  “Well, I had some airmiles left, so I booked some flights into Dublin,” said Simon Williams, bra enthusiast, former boy scout and team leader.  “Trevor’s booked us into a Travelodge which we’ll use as our base camp.”  The group intend to spend a couple of days sewing dissent before they strike.  “We’ll go to some pubs and talk to people about how the EU are all horrible, smelly French people who don’t like bananas and sausages, and that Britain is loads better.”  With the people of Dublin whipped into an anti-EU frenzy, they will then march on the Government, secure the Taoiseach’s resignation, rename the country West Hampshire and fly home.  “We might stop off for a tour of the Croke Park first, and Trevor wants to get a Matchbox Guinness van for his collection, but yes, we should be back by next Thursday and then we can finally achieve our glorious Brexit.”  In a gesture of goodwill to the people of West Hampshire, Mr Williams is prepared to compromise over the country’s new name.  “Oh god, yes, of course. We’re not dictators, if they’d prefer West Wiltshire to West Hampshire then we’ll be fine with that.  “But, I’m sure they’ll just be glad to be rid of that silly foreign name of Eire and have it replaced with something sensible.”",1
62,Disappointment that Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to prevent a no-deal Brexit doesn’t involve armed insurrection,62," Jeremy Corbyn Brexit Jeremy Corbyn has announced plans for a no-confidence vote followed by a temporary government to prevent a no-deal Brexit.  Whilst warmly received in some quarters, there was widespread disappointment that the plan appeared not to feature any sort of armed insurrection.  “Well, I’m pleased that Corbyn and the Labour Party have finally put forward a sensible suggestion that could help us out of this mess, but I must confess, I was hoping for a little more violence in the whole process,” explained Simon Williams, a normal British person who’s had to endure nearly ten years of ruinous Tory government.  “I mean, we’ve had austerity followed by Brexit followed by Boris Johnson, you can’t tell me that someone doesn’t deserve their head on a pike for all that.”  Mr Williams joined others in calling for Mr Corbyn to perhaps include a few days of violent uprising into his scheme.  He went on, “I’m not being greedy, maybe we could start out with some light rioting, then have the army refuse to get involved, then a dramatic march on Downing Street, a sacking of Number 10, and finally pop Boris’s head on a pike.  “After that, Corbyn can crack on with his no-confidence plan, which is great, but I just think it would be good if everyone could work off a little steam first.”  It is understood that Mr Corbyn is now considering introducing a few days of violent insurrection into his plan on the condition that no one smashes up his allotment greenhouse.",1
28,Boris Johnson agrees other MPs should moderate their language,28," Boris language In an interview with the BBC, ‘Prime’ Minister Boris Johnson has agreed that all other MPs should use respectful and moderate language in Commons debates.  His words came in the wake of an exchange yesterday when he invoked a murdered MP in the name of Brexit and other MPs were stridently critical of him.  “I agree with many that the language used against me beyond the pale,” he said, ruffling his own hair in a way that would be charming if he was five and not a fully-grown man.  “I think they need to moderate their language toward me, particularly those slags on the other benches and that Labour pooftah who gets all hot under the collar all the time.  “There was also some ghastly looking fat little common person who had the temerity to raise his voice toward me.  “I tell you, if I was back in my Bullingdon days, we’d have smashed up his car, had a go on his girlfriend and shat on his doorstep.”  He went on to summarise what he hoped to see.  “A bit more respectful language from the whole bally lot of them, I went to Eton, you know. They should show some respect.”  Asked if he would be making any effort to moderate his own language, he was unequivocal.  “Fuck off, I’m the Prime Minister and I’ll do what the fuck I like.  “Now, piss off you ghastly little communist or ill have your kids arrested.”",1
8,"Ellie Cooper, 20, has asked Boris Johnson to call a halt to 'inflammatory and aggressive' language amid fears her mother's safety could be at risk",8," The daughter of Labour MP Yvette Cooper has warned Boris Johnson that she is 'scared every single day' for her mother's safety.  In an emotional plea to the Premier, Ellie Cooper, 20, asked him to call a halt to 'inflammatory and aggressive' language.  Miss Cooper told how she has feared her mother could be killed ever since the murder of Jo Cox.  On Twitter, she wrote: 'Before then, my mum's job was something that kept her working later than bedtime when I was a kid, the source of embarrassing conversations at school, the reason we travelled to and fro between Yorkshire and London every week for the first two thirds of my life.  'It was never something that could get her killed. I am scared when I scroll through the replies to her tweets calling her a liar and a traitor.  'I am scared when our house gets fitted with panic buttons, industrial-locking doors and explosive bags to catch the mail.  'I am scared because on 16 June 2016, two children said goodbye to their mother before she left for her constituency to sit in surgeries and help people all day, and never saw her again.  'I am scared every single day that the same will happen to mine.'  Labour MP Yvette Cooper has had panic alarms installed in her home amid rising fears of an attack on MPs  Miss Cooper, whose father is former MP Ed Balls, added: 'Of course people have strong opinions, opinions that will inevitably come into conflict when trying to work out how best to deliver an outcome that split our country in two.  'But what we need now is a Prime Minister who can stand up and say ''Yes I want to deliver Brexit, but regardless of my position, this inflammatory and aggressive language needs to stop''.  Her mother, the former work and pensions secretary, replied: 'We get used to handling all the things that get thrown at us, but it's harder to see it through your children's eyes. I am very proud of my brave daughter.'",0
39,﻿Drunken Boris Johnson staggers into Supreme Court and demands trial-by-combat,39,"Boris Johnson at Supreme Court Boris Johnson has shocked everybody by doing something stupendously daft.  The former Honey Monster and current Prime Minister burst into the main chamber of the Supreme Court with a half-empty tin of Special Brew in his hand, demanding that the legality regarding the proroguing of parliament be settled via combat.  “RUFF RAHHHHH!” declared the visibly intoxicated Prime Minister.  “Let’s have it, shall we? Fists, swords or ruddy cricket bats. I don’t care. Trial by combat is the way forward. It’s the only way for a sensible Britain.  “Let’s have me versus Corbyn, winner take all. No holds barred. And so forth.”  Judge Elizabeth King said, “This almost never happens.  “However, we are considering the Prime Minister’s proposal with the utmost degree of seriousness – which is in stark contrast to the consideration we’ve given his previous proposals.  “I mean…a BRIDGE between Scotland and Northern Ireland? Come off it.  “But a fistfight for Brexit between Johnson and Corbyn? I’d pay to see that.”",1
15,Boris Johnson tells members of Parliament that if they want to stop receiving death threats they need to back Brexit.,15," MPs have reported a surge in death threats from members of the public since the Brexit vote.  However, the prime minister told friends of the murdered MP Jo Cox, that the best way to honour her death and prevent further death threats would be to deliver his plans to leave the EU.  He accused his opponents of ""surrender"" and dismissed claims that his language was putting the lives of pro-European politicians at risk.  Opposition and Conservative politicians, and Cox's husband Brendan, condemned the prime minister's comments.  Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.  Boris Johnson has triggered a fresh wave of outrage after telling friends of the murdered member of Parliament Jo Cox to back Brexit, if they want to stop receiving death threats.  The pro-European Labour MP Cox was murdered on the streets of her constituency during the Brexit referendum campaign in 2016 by a man shouting ""Britain first."" He later told the court his name was ""death to traitors, freedom for Britain.""  However, Johnson on Wednesday evening told MPs that the best way to honour Cox's memory and stop the growing number of death threats received from the public was to ""get Brexit done.""  The prime minister used his first appearance in the House of Commons since the Supreme Court ruled that his decision to shut down Parliament was illegal, to accuse his opponents of signing up to a ""surrender bill"" compelling the United Kingdom to delay Brexit.

Several of Cox's former colleagues walked out in anger as the House of Commons descended into the most heated scenes seen in the chamber in living memory.  In an emotional speech Labour MP Paula Sheriff, who was a close friend of Cox, told Johnson he should be ""ashamed"" of his language and warned him that he was putting the lives of her and her colleagues at risk.  Johnson dismissed her comments as ""humbug.""  Watch Boris Johnson dismiss Paula Sheriff's emotional plea  Asked again to tone down his rhetoric in order to prevent a repeat of what happened to Cox, Johnson replied that ""the best way to ensure that every Parliamentarian is properly safe and we dial down the current anxiety in this country is to get Brexit done.""  Johnson's comments led to a wave of outrage among both opposition and Conservative politicians.  The former Conservative Attorney General Dominic Grieve labeled Johnson a ""pathological liar"" with ""no moral compass of any kind.""  Johnson's former chief of staff when he was Mayor of London, Nick Boles, tweeted that ""Boris Johnson will go down in history as one of the most callous and reckless human beings ever to occupy No 10 Downing St.""  Conservative MP Stephen Crabb said that Johnson ""has a duty as Prime Minister to try to bring unity to our country and reduce the level of poison in our politics,"" adding that he was ""shocked by the way he responded to remarks about Jo Cox.""  Even Johnson's Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan appeared to criticise the PM, tweeting that ""we all need to remind ourselves of the effect of everything we say on those watching us.""  —Nicky Morgan MP (@NickyMorgan01) September 25, 2019  Cox's husband Brendan tweeted that he ""[feels] a bit sick at Jo's name being used in this way.""  During the Commons debate, a number of MPs revealed details of threats sent to themselves and their loved ones.  Former minister Anna Soubry was on the verge of tears when she said that her mother and her partner had received threats to their safety.  Jo Swinson, leader of the Liberal Democrats, revealed that she had reported to the Police a threat to her son that very day.  Swinson later described Johnson's remarks as ""sickening"" and called on him to apologise immediately.",0
13,brexit countdown_bg Created with Sketch.,13," MPs have rejected Tory pleas to suspend Parliament for three days at the start of next week to allow the Conservative Party conference to go ahead without disruption.  Furious opposition MPs took their revenge on Boris Johnson as they voted by 306 to 289, a majority of 17, against a short parliamentary recess.  The Tories have said the conference event in Manchester will still go ahead but today's vote raises the prospect of the annual showpiece being majorly disrupted by events back in Westminster.  The government fears that without the recess and with Parliament still sitting, MPs could try to ambush ministers with emergency debates and questions, forcing them to hurry back to London.  One annoyed government source told MailOnline: 'Of course they [opposition MPs] are going to try to cause trouble.'  Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg arriving at a political cabinet meeting in Downing Street tonight  The meeting was also attended by Chancellor Sajid Javid (left) and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab (right)  Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock (right) with Paymaster General Oliver Dowden outside Number 10  Boris Johnson gathered senior ministers for a meeting of his political Cabinet this evening in Downing Street.  A senior Conservative source said they has agreed that the vote result 'would not interfere' with the event in Manchester.  'They agreed that conference is an important occasion for members and a lot of Manchester businesses were reliant on the event taking place in its full format,' the said.  'Cabinet agreed that conference should address the public’s biggest concern of getting Brexit done to allow Government to deliver on people’s domestic priorities.'  Another government source said blocking recess was a 'deliberate and cynical act' and was 'another example of this Parliament being broken'.  Meanwhile, MPs' refusal to give the Tories time off could push Boris Johnson towards trying again to prorogue Parliament.  The PM has made clear that he wants to end this parliamentary session so that his new government can set out its domestic legislative agenda in a Queen's Speech.  Mr Johnson is likely to be incensed by the defeat and the prospect of MPs trying to disrupt his party's conference and it could prompt him to push the nuclear button for a second time.  There are rumours swirling in Westminster this afternoon that the PM could prorogue Parliament within days but the decision would only be made public after Mr Johnson had secured the Queen's backing.  The Supreme Court ruled earlier this week that Mr Johnson's original five-week prorogation was unlawful but it is thought a shorter suspension would be within the boundaries of the law.  The vote this afternoon came after Mr Johnson vowed to carry on referring to an anti-No Deal law as the 'Surrender Act' despite a wave of criticism as he continued to lay the groundwork for a 'People versus Parliament' general election campaign.  Mr Johnson told a meeting of the influential 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs today that he had no intention of watering down his description of the rebel legislation.  He was rebuked by Commons Speaker John Bercow last night for repeatedly referring to the so-called Benn Act as the 'Surrender Act', prompting howls of derision from opposition MPs.  But Mr Johnson reportedly told his backbenchers that ‘they [Labour] are trying to drive us off the word surrender because they know it is cutting through’.  MPs today voted 306 to 289 against going ahead with a three day recess at the start of next week in a move which represents a major headache for the Conservative Party conference  The Prime Minister (pictured in Downing Street today) told MPs last night he intends to press ahead with a Queen's speech in the coming weeks in order to bring forward a new agenda of domestic policies  The Prime Minister was swiftly followed by his aide Dominic Cummings. The PM has faced calls to sack Mr Cummings following the Supreme Court bombshell  What does today's vote against recess mean for prorogation? A recess to allow party conferences to take place has been a standard part of the parliamentary calendar for many years. By rejecting a request for a three day break at the start of next week, opposition MPs have seemingly torn up convention. The move means the Conservative Party conference in Manchester will have to take place while Parliament is sitting. That means the government could be ambushed by MPs demanding urgent questions and debates which could force ministers to have to hurry back to Westminster. It is an incendiary move and will cause anger in Downing Street. Boris Johnson is believed to be considering trying to prorogue Parliament again in order to hold a Queen's Speech. The fact that he has just lost his seventh vote out of seven since becoming PM may well accelerate such a suspension because now more than ever the government needs a clean slate. There are rumours swirling in Westminster this afternoon that the PM could prorogue Parliament within days but the decision would only be made public after Mr Johnson had secured the Queen's backing.  The PM's decision to recommit to using the phrase will cause uproar among Remain-backing MPs who believe his rhetoric is putting their safety in jeopardy.  Conservative MPs cheered and banged on tables as the Prime Minister arrived for the meeting in Parliament today as the premier continues to prepare his troops for an election he has long demanded and which could take place by the end of the year.  MPs said after the meeting had finished that the PM had been 'ebullient’ and ‘full of bonhomie’ despite being under-fire from his critics.  Last night he dared opposition leaders to bring forward a vote of no confidence to try to topple him and trigger a snap poll.  But all of them said they will only try to get rid of him once a No Deal Brexit has been ruled out.  Despite the set back for Mr Johnson, Downing Street remains convinced that there will be a snap election sooner rather than later.  As a result Number 10 is now moving into full campaign mode with Mr Johnson ramping up his attacks on Remainer MPs amid growing speculation he could try to prorogue Parliament again.  However, Mr Johnson is today facing a huge backlash after last night telling MPs that the best way to honour Jo Cox, a Labour MP who was murdered by a far-right terrorist, was to deliver Brexit.  He also appeared to dismiss MPs' claims that incendiary language was putting their lives at risk.  Rudd leads Remainer ex-Tories against Boris Johnson in recess vote Former home secretary Amber Rudd led a hardcore group of ex-Tories who voted against the government over recess today. The Hastings MP was joined in the No lobby by a hardcore of Conservative Remainers including former chancellor Ken Clarke, Theresa May's justice secretary David Gauke, ex-education secretary Justine Greening and Dominic Grieve, who was once attorney general. They had the whip removed by Mr Johnson earlier this month after voting to block a No Deal Brexit. But several others backed the PM today, including ex-Tory ministers Greg Clark, Caroline Nokes and Steve Brine. Ten current Tories, including Dame Caroline Spelman, the former party chairwoman, and ex-Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley, did not vote.  In a sign of the worsening relations in the Commons, MPs this afternoon voted against giving the Tories a conference recess despite the fact that such breaks in the parliamentary calendar are a long-held convention.  The Tories said their conference will still go ahead but it is likely some events may have to be re-arranged.  Mr Johnson is due to address the conference on Wednesday and a Tory source told the Huffington Post that plan had not changed.  That raises the prospect of Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary and First Secretary of State, being asked to step in to cover for Mr Johnson at PMQs.  The government was defeated in today's vote at least in part because a number of former Tory MPs who were stripped of the whip or quit over Brexit voted against Mr Johnson.  Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Dominic Grieve were among the ex-Conservatives to vote with the opposition.  A Tory source said: 'This was an attempt to deliberately undermine an event for party members. That is not the act of MPs who value the hard work of party members and activists.'  The government is worried that without a recess opposition MPs will wreak havoc by triggering crunch votes in the Commons, forcing ministers and Conservative backbenchers to have to shuttle to and from Manchester.  Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Commons Leader, said after the vote result was announced that the government would table seemingly non-offensive and non-political business to be debated at the start of next week in an apparent bid to stop disruption.  However, with the Tories' request for a recess on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday rejected, there are no guarantees that MPs will not try to embarrass the government.  Today's defeat in the Commons was Mr Johnson's seventh in a row since he became PM.  The Prime Minister suggested yesterday that he is drawing up plans to try to prorogue Parliament again.  Can Boris Johnson try to prorogue Parliament again? Boris Johnson is believed to be planning to suspend Parliament again as he tries to hold a Queen's Speech so that his government can set out its domestic legislative agenda. The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that his five-week suspension of Parliament was unlawful. But the court did suggest that a shorter prorogation of four or five days would be acceptable. It said that such a period of time was normal for prorogation purposes. Downing Street is still examining the court's judgement but there is growing speculation that Number 10 could move to prorogue Parliament again in the coming days. Any move to suspend Parliament would be massively controversial given that MPs have only just returned to work. But the government will be hopeful that a shorter prorogation would not fall foul of the courts. Mr Johnson has made clear that he wants to deliver a fresh Queen's Speech and had previously set a date of October 14. But the timing of when a prorogation order could be made is yet to be set out.  The rejection of the proposed recess could well accelerate those plans.  The Supreme Court ruled earlier this week that Mr Johnson's five week prorogation of Parliament was unlawful.  But the PM has said he still wants to hold a Queen's Speech so that he can set out a new domestic legislative agenda.  That raises the prospect of the PM trying to suspend Parliament for a shorter period of perhaps a week in a move which will spark anger among Remainer MPs who will argue they have only just got back to work.  Mr Johnson yesterday brushed aside demands for him to apologise over his failed prorogation as he recommitted to holding a Queen's Speech.  He said: 'I think we need a Queen's Speech. We have a dynamic domestic agenda.'  Asked when he might move to trigger another suspension, Mr Johnson said: 'I will be informing [MPs] as soon as we have assessed the meaning of the court's ruling.'  Speaking on ITV's Peston show last night, Mr Johnson confirmed he was undeterred by the Supreme Court's bombshell unanimous ruling.  He said: 'I think the public should see what we want to do and I think it's a great shame that the opposition are sort of gridlocked.  'They don't want either to have an election. They don't want Brexit to get done. They don't seem to want anything.  'So my urging them would be: if you seriously don't want to have an election, then let's get on with a strong domestic agenda of the kind we have.'  Mr Johnson had challenged opposition MPs to bring forward a vote of no confidence last night as he said he would make time available for a division if any party wanted to try to get rid of him.  But none of the other parties took the bait.  Downing Street said that if MPs did not try to oust the PM then he would take that as a sign that Parliament does in fact have confidence in him and his Brexit strategy.  Number 10 said if no confidence vote was tabled then Mr Johnson would determine that he has a mandate from MPs to carry on as he sees fit.  The remarks were widely interpreted as a signal that the Prime Minister will try to prorogue Parliament again.  The row over recess came as Mr Johnson faced sustained calls to apologise after he said the 'best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox, and indeed to bring this country together, would be, I think, to get Brexit done'.  He also dismissed as 'humbug' claims made by Labour MP Paula Sherriff that the 'pejorative language' he has used on Brexit was putting the safety of parliamentarians at risk.  Ms Sheriff said all politicians needed to 'moderate our language' as she pointed to Ms Cox's commemorative shield on the wall in the House of Commons.  But Mr Johnson replied: 'I have to say that I have never heard such humbug in all my life.'  Brendan Cox, Jo's widower, said he felt 'a bit sick' after hearing Mr Jonson's remarks.  What will Boris Johnson do next? PM wants to SHUT DOWN Parliament just days after reopening its doors as he ponders attempt to prorogue it AGAIN but MPs vow to block his an attempt to hold an uninterrupted Tory conference next week  MPs today voted against a three day recess to allow the Conservative Party conference to go ahead as planned next week.  The decision by MPs to block the brief recess has sparked anger in the government because it means the Tories will have to meet in Manchester while Parliament continues to sit.  Meanwhile, today's vote could prompt Boris Johnson to accelerate plans to try again to prorogue Parliament.  Here are the answers to all of the key questions arising from another chaotic day in British politics.  Why does the Government want a recess?  After the furious row over Boris Johnson's overruled attempt to prorogue Parliament, his Government will try to force through a short recess from Monday to Wednesday next week  In normal times the Commons votes to have a short recess in the autumn to allow the parties' annual conferences to go ahead unimpeded.  Recesses are essentially fixed-length halts in the parliamentary term and take place after a vote by MPs.  It means Ministers and shadow ministers do not find themselves having to be in two places and blocks political chicanery from taking place in the absence of one party.  But these are not normal times. Boris Johnson's plan to prorogue Parliament - call an end to the current session and start another following a Queen's Speech - meant the recess vote never took place.  After the Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that Boris Johnson had acted unlawfully and prorogation was null and void, MPs found themselves back in the Commons with no conference recess agreed.  This was fine for Labour and the Lib Dems, who have had their events already.  But the Conservatives are due to descend on Manchester from Sunday, with Boris Johnson due to address the party faithful on Wednesday.  Without a recess that speech will clash with his appearance at Prime Minister's Questions.  More importantly, ministers fear that opposition parties will use the absence of Tory MPs for political ends - forcing them to come back to London at short notice to answer urgent questions and make statements - or even force votes on Brexit related measures.  The Tories have made clear they will press on with the conference despite the turmoil. The event is a major money-spinner for the party and cancelling would leave a big dent in its finances just months before an expected election.  Commons' Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg last night confirmed that he would seek to force a recess in a vote this afternoon.  Whether it succeeds rests on the attitude of 21 former Tory MPs who lost the whip after voting against the Government but remain Tory party members. If they fall into line it could pass, narrowly.  But how can Boris Johnson prorogue Parliament AGAIN after his court defeat?  Mr Johnson (pictured last night) has made clear that he wants to deliver a fresh Queen's Speech and had previously set a date of October 14.  Boris Johnson is believed to be planning to suspend Parliament again as he tries to hold a Queen's Speech so that his government can set out its domestic legislative agenda.  The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that his five-week suspension of Parliament was unlawful.  But the court did suggest that a shorter prorogation of four or five days would be acceptable.  It said that such a period of time was normal for prorogation purposes.  Downing Street is still examining the court's judgement but there is growing speculation that Number 10 could move to prorogue Parliament again in the coming days.  Any move to suspend Parliament would be massively controversial given that MPs have only just returned to work.  But the government will be hopeful that a shorter prorogation would not fall foul of the courts.  Mr Johnson has made clear that he wants to deliver a fresh Queen's Speech and had previously set a date of October 14.  But the timing of when a prorogation order could be made is yet to be set out.  It is thought that the timing could be impacted by the outcome of the recess vote this afternoon.  If MPs reject the Conservatives' request for the recess it may well act as the trigger for Mr Johnson to try to shut Parliament sooner rather than later.  How will the Remainers try to thwart Boris's Brexit plans?  Rebel MPs are plotting firm action designed to hem in the Prime Minister over Brexit.  But there is an apparent split between the Lib Dems and ex-Tories over whether they should try to strengthen an anti-No Deal law designed to force Boris Johnson to delay Brexit.  Under the so-called Benn Act passed at the start of the month Mr Johnson will have to go to Brussels on October 19 and beg for a three-month Article 50 extension if he has not agreed an exit deal with the EU by then.  But with the PM insisting Brexit will still happen on Halloween, with or without a deal, Remainers fear he is preparing to break the law.  Some are worried that the current legislation to force his hand might may not be strong enough and want to make it 'bulletproof'.  The Lib Dems are leading the charge and want to bring forward new rebel legislation which would force the PM to ask for a delay long before the middle of October - perhaps as early as next week.  But the 21 ex-Tory MPs are against tampering with the existing law. Instead they want to use the time between now and October to hold the Prime Minister's feet to the fire in different ways.  Forcing Boris to ask for Brexit delay from EU with a new law blocking No Deal  Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said yesterday that the Benn Act, an emergency law passed weeks ago forcing Boris Johnson to seek an extension to Article 50, needed strengthening.  It is due to take effect from October 19 if there is no deal in place, mandating an application for a three-month Brexit delay. Government sources have suggested Mr Johnson might try to ignore it.  In a jibe at the Prime Minister following his Supreme Court defeat yesterday Ms Swinson said: 'We simply cannot afford to wait until the 19th of October to see whether or not the Prime Minister will refuse to obey the law again.'  Using Parliamentary rules to take control of the Commons  Ideas floating about include using emergency debate powers to seize control of the order paper, or use a 'humble address' to force the Government to release more Brexit documents.  Some MPs are reportedly planning to try to force the government to publish its prorogation legal advice from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox in full.  The Remain-backing MPs know they have a majority in the Commons and could also try to reinforce the recently passed anti-No Deal law to make it 'bullet proof' amid suggestions the PM could try to ignore it.  Supporters of a so-called 'People's Vote' will be considering whether they could use the shifting balance of power in Westminster to secure their goal.  Labour currently supports a second referendum, but only after an election.  Find Mr Johnson in contempt of Parliament  They could also make moves to find Mr Johnson in contempt of Parliament. Without a majority the PM can in effect do very little to stop them.  Action could be taken against Mr Johnson over his illegal advice to the Queen, with the possibility of contempt proceedings. Theoretically this could include stripping him of his salary - or even imprisoning him at Parliament, although the latter seems very unlikely.  It has also been suggested that MPs could put Theresa May's deal back on the table, but try to attach a 'confirmatory vote' or second referendum.  They could also possibly try to dictate the negotiating strategy of the government, by passing laws instructing them to seek certain terms.  A vote of No Confidence in the Prime Minister  Jeremy Corbyn, pictured on stage in Brighton at Labour conference immediately after the Supreme Court ruling, said Mr Johnson must now 'consider his position'  Such a vote, which could bring down the Government, seems unlikely to be held immediately.  Mr Johnson laid down the gauntlet to opposition parties last night as he said that if any of them wanted to try to topple him then he would make time tomorrow for a vote of no confidence to take place.  That vote would only require a simple majority to succeed and it would then trigger a 14 day period in which another government could be formed.  If no one was able to command a majority in the Commons at the end of that period it would prompt an election to be held after a 25 day campaign period - likely at the end of November.  The responsibility for seeking a vote of no confidence has so far rested with Mr Corbyn as the leader of the opposition, and he has said it will not happen until after the 'threat of No Deal is taken off the table'.  That date that could be as late as October 19, because they want a No Deal Brexit to be ruled out before they push for a vote. A No Confidence vote it could lead to a general election, which sees parliament shut down for five weeks of campaigning, meaning there would be a risk of an accidental hard Brexit if it was triggered too early.  Mr Corbyn said today: 'Until it is very clear that the application will be made, per the legislation, to the EU to extend our membership to at least January, then we will continue pushing for that (blocking No Deal) and that is our priority.'  He added: 'When that has been achieved we will then be ready with a motion of no confidence.'  The vote would almost certainly be tight. Mr Johnson would expect to count on the support of the overwhelming majority of Tory MPs although today's Supreme Court ruling could make some think long and hard about backing the PM.  Mr Johnson would also likely be supported by a number of Labour Brexit-backing MPs as well as the DUP.  On the other side, if Mr Corbyn was to launch a push to get rid of Mr Johnson he would likely only do so if he believed all the other opposition parties were on board.  Lib Dem sources have suggested they could now back a vote of no confidence while the SNP would leap at any opportunity to boot out Mr Johnson.  The parliamentary arithmetic means that the result could ultimately come down to how a group of 21 Tory rebels who were stripped of the whip by the PM after backing the anti-No Deal law would vote.  Block a general election before Brexit Day on October 31  The ruling represents a major set back for Mr Johnson, pictured in New York today, who is now facing calls to resign. He said he believes the court made the wrong decision  The Prime Minister wants to have an election as soon as possible and has tried to call one twice, using the Fixed Term Parliament Act (FTPA), but was voted down by the opposition.  They know they hold the trump card, just as they do on the No Confidence vote, and will strike when it decides the time is right.  Despite spending months demanding a general election Mr Corbyn will delay until a No Deal Brexit is ruled out before acquiescing.  It means the election everyone knows is coming is unlikely to be before November or December, with some in Labour suggesting they could hold off until the spring.  But the 21 Tory rebels DON'T want to play ball. What do they want to do instead?  Meanwhile, the 21 Tory MPs who were stripped of the whip are believed to be opposed to Ms Swinson's proposals.  They reportedly favour leaving the anti-No Deal law as it is and concentrating instead on ramping up the scrutiny of the PM's Brexit plans.  It is thought the 21 former Tories want to use parliamentary procedures and arcane devices to force the government to publish more details of its No Deal contingency planning and to keep the pressure on the PM with urgent questions and debates.  Such methods have proved productive for rebel MPs in the past as they have previously forced the government to hand over Brexit economic impact assessments and No Deal documents.",0
10,Boris Johnson told his ministers yesterday that the Tories are on course for election victory.,10," His message came as Jeremy Corbyn finally signalled that he would agree to go to the polls this year.  The Prime Minister told his Cabinet that the strategy is to target 50 marginal seats and defend another 50, aiming for a 'functional majority' in the House of Commons.  Boris Johnson told his ministers yesterday that the Tories are on course for election victory  He said the slogan for next week's Conservative conference will be: Get Brexit done.  Mr Johnson warned hardline Brexiteers – known as the Spartans – who have refused to vote for a deal that they would not get everything they want, saying: 'Even the Spartans are going to have to compromise.'  Internal polling shows that the Prime Minister is 'miles ahead on leadership and the numbers are moving in the right direction', ministers were told, while Tory sources said this month had been the best ever for fundraising.  One Cabinet minister said: 'Labour must have the same numbers which is why they're running scared from election.'  Mr Corbyn has committed to whip Labour MPs to vote for a general election once a Brexit extension is secured from the EU.  He also pledged further parliamentary action to ensure Mr Johnson requests a delay to Brexit, as demanded by the 'Benn Act' passed by opposition parties and rebel former Tory MPs.  His message came as Jeremy Corbyn finally signalled that he would agree to go to the polls this year  In an interview, Mr Corbyn said: 'It's not a matter of choice for him, it's an Act of Parliament that was passed.'  Pressed on whether he would whip his MPs to vote for an election the moment a Brexit extension is agreed, the Labour leader said: 'Absolutely.'  Asked if this would mean an election this year, Mr Corbyn agreed that it would.  Many Labour MPs, including deputy leader Tom Watson, have called for a second Brexit referendum to be held before any election.  Last night, former prime minister Sir John Major warned that the election will be bitter and wounding.  In a speech to the Centre for European Reform, he said: 'In the present atmosphere it would be likely to become the most unsavoury election of modern times. All parties profess to believe an election is necessary to clear the air.  Last night, former prime minister Sir John Major warned that the election will be bitter and wounding  'I disagree. Until Brexit is resolved, a general election would solve nothing. It would merely fuel the current feeling of disillusionment and disunity.  'Far from healing the nation, it would scratch away at open wounds.  'It may also be pointless, as the most likely outcome is another fragmented Parliament, even more bitterly divided than it is now.'",0
71,Ku Klux Klan quick to distance themselves from Hard Brexiters,71," KKK quick to disassociate themselves from hard brexiters After news that a number of hard-line Brexiteers have started to refer to themselves as ‘Grand Wizards’, members of the Ku Klux Klan have been quick to disassociate themselves from the group.  After a century of building up what they see as a ‘level of credibility’, the KKK is concerned that an association with the likes of Iain Duncan Smith, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson could leave their reputations in tatters.  Current Klan Grand Wizard Billy-Bob Williams was the most vocal in his rejection of the ideals of the hard Brexiters.  He told reporters, “We in the KKK have a long and glorious tradition of being associated with petty mindedness, bigotry and racism – so to see us being associated with such simpletons and liars is of great offence to us as an organisation.  “We have great belief in our mission, we are not in it just to try and make a few bucks. Frankly, we’re pretty sure even ERG doesn’t believe what they’re saying these days.  We might be racist nutjobs, but even we can see Brexit is a terrible idea.  “And dropping clues you might be racist to get racists to vote for you? That’s low man. They’re making those of us that genuinely don’t like immigrants – and are happy saying it publicly – look really bad. Own it, for f*cks sake!”  Billy-Bob was asked if there were any current British politicians he actually admired, to which he answered “very few”.  “That said,” he added, “I really liked Theresa May’s ‘go home’ immigrant vans from a few years ago. She seems like a really classy lady.”",1
24,Markets rally as Parliament restores Brexit to its normal status of pointless clusterfuck,24," Market rally on Brexit vote The pound rose by 2 cents against the euro following a crucial defeat in the Commons of a government motion that could have endangered the UK’s status as a confused state lurching from crisis to crisis.  City of London stockbroker and champion cocaine user, Simon Williams, was one of many to breathe a sigh of relief when it was announced Britain would once again be in a state of constant disarray.  He explained, “What matters most for investors is predictability. And for the past two years, we have been able to rely on Britain being completely chaotic and devoid of any sense of purpose.”  Mr Williams explained that few of his investor colleagues were worried about a ‘No Deal’ scenario.  “Quite the opposite. For a start, the borders will collapse which means cheaper coke and trafficked sex workers from Belarus which are the two pillars of our profession. And No Deal would actually be quite lucrative for those of us who don’t create jack shit but just gamble other people’s money. We have taken several short positions on the UK going through a catastrophic economic meltdown in the next three years.  “I’ll be honest with you, I thought it was hugely risky but Jacob, a good friend of mine, told me he’d make sure Britain would be out of the G20 by the end of the decade. Lovely chap. A bit old fashioned but if you want to make a few quid from this mess, he’s your man.  “His outfit is based out of Dublin if you’re interested.”",1
49,"With his bombastic battle-cry of 'Get Brexit Done', Boris Johnson left the conference stage to ecstatic applause.",49," His first speech as PM was everything they were hoping for: impassioned, optimistic and funny.  On Brexit he was typically bullish about leaving on time, and rattled through plans that he promised would build a 'positive new partnership' with the EU.  With his bombastic battle-cry of 'Get Brexit Done', Boris Johnson left the Conservative Party Conference stage to ecstatic applause at the Manchester Convention Centre  No longer can critics accuse him of not trying to get a deal; he has presented a serious proposal and thrown down the gauntlet to Brussels.  The stakes could hardly be higher on both sides. The blamegame has truly begun.  Boris's blueprint is radically different from anything Theresa May even considered, and arises from a combination of principle and political necessity.  Johnson has long argued that Mrs May's deal would have made trade deals impossible. He wants us to be free to go our own way after Brexit.  The logical consequence of that position is there must be a customs border between Northern Ireland and the south.  But there will be no border checks – which would inflame nationalist sentiment.  The Prime Minister (pictured with Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid) was typically bullish about Brexit and rattled through plans that he promised would build a 'positive new partnership' with the EU  For example, an Australian tractor would face checks as it crossed from Liverpool to Belfast to make sure it met product standards.  If it was then moved across the border to Dublin, it would be tracked and would face customs checks where it left and where it arrived.  But what about regulatory checks, which Brussels insists are needed on goods entering the EU?  On this, Mr Johnson – and his allies in the DUP – have offered a significant compromise which would see Northern Ireland follow EU rules.  He has taken the two border challenges – customs and regulations – and split them between the two sides.  Call it a fudge if you like, it is a workable attempt to solve an intractable problem.  Boris's blueprint is radically different from anything Theresa May even considered, and arises from a combination of principle and political necessity (pictured with girlfriend Carrie Symonds)  To sweeten the bitter pill of having laws for Northern Ireland set by Brussels, the Northern Ireland Assembly and executive must sign off the plan now and every four years.  With some considerable force in his letter Mr Johnson said these votes were 'fundamental to democracy'.  As soon as the proposals were published, all eyes were on Arlene Foster of the DUP.  Would her party declare 'no surrender' and kill it off? No. Standing shoulder to shoulder with Mr Johnson at a raucous Tory conference rally on Tuesday night, it was clear they were fully inside the tent.  In theory, these developments could unlock a narrow majority in Parliament.  Many of the 21 Tory MPs who were stripped of the whip will still vote for a deal. With the DUP onside, that's ten more.  And if the DUP don't object, most of the European Research Group will back the deal, as could more than a dozen Labour MPs.  So what is Brussels' next move?  If Brussels were to dismiss the deal or place impossible obstacles in its path it would be a sign they are listening to Remainers such as Tony Blair and Dominic Grieve, who say there should be a second referendum with an option to stay.  For some – though not all – EU leaders, this would be a preferred outcome.  On the other hand, perhaps Emmanuel Macron will seize a chance to kick Britain out as quickly as possible? Will Angela Merkel be as uncompromising as when she stifled David Cameron's renegotiation? Will Varadkar realise he is in a hole, facing a No Deal disaster?  Surprisingly, it is Cognacswilling commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in whom senior ministers are investing hope. Shortly to retire, doing a Brexit deal would be a lasting legacy.  Turning the deal down would surely be a tactical error.  There is a slim possibility of Remainer MPs getting their acts together enough to force a second referendum, and it would string things out for months if not years.  Much more likely is that the courts force the UK to follow the terms of the so-called 'Surrender Act' – which prevents a No Deal Brexit – and delay our leaving the EU, prompting a general election.  If the polls are right, Mr Johnson could triumph, and with a Commons majority he would be in a much stronger position.  The threat was clear in Mr Johnson's conference speech: 'Let us be in no doubt that the alternative is No Deal.'  Last night, No 10 officials said that if the answer is a flat 'No', Mr Johnson won't even attend the summit in two weeks' time when the deal would be signed off. So EU leaders have a choice.  They can engage, be pragmatic and try to find a solution.  Or they can turn over the negotiating table and walk away before Boris Johnson has even sat down.",0
4,Prime Minister Boris Johnson suffered a record seventh defeat in the House of Commons on Thursday when members of Parliament rejected his request to allow them to leave for the Conservative Party conference next week.,4," The refusal to allow the Conservatives a conference recess breaks a long tradition between the political parties in the UK.  It came one day after Johnson was found to have broken the law by suspending Parliament for several weeks.  The Conservatives had argued that any refusal would damage businesses in Manchester, where the conference is due to take place.  Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday suffered a record seventh House of Commons defeat when members of Parliament voted to wreck the Conservative Party's annual conference by refusing a parliamentary recess.  The party is due to meet in Manchester on Sunday, with a speech by the prime minister on Wednesday.  However, MPs voted 306-289 on Thursday against allowing a Commons recess, meaning Parliament will still sit next week.  Former Conservative MPs who were kicked out of the party after rebelling on Brexit helped defeat the government, with the former Cabinet ministers David Gauke and Amber Rudd voting against the motion.  It throws the party's plans for the event into chaos and raises the prospect of Conservative MPs shuttling between Manchester and London from Sunday to Wednesday.  There was more confusion on Thursday when the government's chief whip emailed contradictory instructions to MPs.  In one email to Conservative MPs, and seen by Business Insider, Mark Spencer said while the conference would go ahead as planned, the government would ""need as many of you in London as possible.""  However, he later sent another email, also seen by Business Insider, urging Conservative MPs to attend the conference in Manchester.  Conferences are usually an opportunity for Cabinet ministers to make headline-grabbing policy announcements and can often hand the party in question a significant boost in polls.  But Jeremy Corbyn indicated on Wednesday that his Labour Party, which held its conference over the weekend, would not support attempts to shut down Parliament for the conference next week until Johnson backed down on his threats to break the law and force a no-deal Brexit on October 31.  Read more: Boris Johnson tells friends of slain MP Jo Cox to back Brexit if they want to stop getting death threats  ""I won't support anything that shuts down Parliament until it is absolutely clear that the government will abide by the law and apply for an extension,"" he told BBC Radio 4's ""Today"" program.  Johnson lost his working majority in the Commons earlier this month when he withdrew the Conservative whip from 21 rebels, meaning he would struggle to win any vote in the chamber.  Eight of those expelled MPs voted against the government on Thursday, helping to defeat the motion.  Usually, the government tables a motion at the start of September to allow a recess for each party to hold its conference over several weekends until October. But Johnson instead attempted to shut down Parliament from the start of September — a decision that on Wednesday was ruled unlawful — meaning MPs did not have a chance to vote on the usual recess schedule.",0
35,Brexiters fear European elections could create a rift between idiots and racists,35," old people fighting Many prominent leave supporters are deeply concerned that the European elections could threaten the long-standing alliance between racists and easily-duped cretins, that has always been the foundation of British Euroscepticism.  The division of the most ardent Europhobes into 2 distinct parties has many worried that the potent combination that propelled the brexit vote, of closet white supremacists and dim nostalgics who aren’t keen on spicy food, is in peril. As explained Daily Mail columnists and best-selling author of ‘Everything Was Better Before’, Simon Williams.  “The people who just want to hurt ethnic minorities will be firmly support UKIP whereas Nigel Farage will sweep up the votes of fearful codgers who hope they can recreate their childhood in the few years before they shuffle off this mortal coil.  “The big fear is that these two parties will not be as potent as when they are combined. After all, UKIP is already suffering from the lack of dumb but well-meaning biddies to shove in front of the headcases who dream of ethnic cleansing. Like Tommy Robinson.  “As for the new Brexit Party, genteel retirees who are still resentful of having to learn the metric system may vote in large numbers, but they aren’t exactly energetic campaigners. Mainly because of their hips.  “And that’s without mentioning the fact that many dimwits and bigots are finding they are actually well represented by some Tory politicians, like Mark Francois.”  However, Mr Williams said there was still hope that Brexit supporters could send a record number of MEPs to sponge off the system they claim to hate.  He concluded, “Well thankfully the Remain parties are refusing to unite and make common cause. And Labour is just pretending Brexit doesn’t exist.  “We can always rely on old Jeremy.”",1

66,Boris Johnson hails successful trial of post-Brexit rolling power blackouts,66," Boris Johnson on power cuts One million people were left without power for much of yesterday and survived, an experience which the Prime Minister has said bodes extremely well for life in Brexit Britain.  Train passengers were stranded, traffic lights failed to work and thousands of homes were plunged into darkness during the blackout.  “These rolling power blackouts will be commonplace after Brexit,” said Boris Johnson to reporters this morning.  “So having these trial runs will put us all in good stead for life as an independent nation. With a bit of mental gymnastics, you could almost view them as one of the Brexit dividends. Somehow.  “During these times our carbon footprint will be reduced, and no-one died yesterday, did they?”  He concluded, “There’s no harm to be had in fumbling around blindly in the dark, unless of course you’re making love to one of your mistresses and can’t find a condom – but enough about my private life.”  Scotland was completely unaffected by the power outage yesterday, which provided a strong metaphor for those calling for IndyRef2.",1
46,UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has sent Brussels his ‘take it or leave it’ Brexit offer that would see the Irish backstop replaced with electronic and a “number of physical” customs checks on the island of Ireland.,46," Publishing his letter to the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday via social media, Johnson’s “final offer” Brexit proposals contain alternatives to the contentious Irish backstop issue, which he describes as a ""bridge to nowhere.""  If ratified, it would mean that Northern Ireland would remain in the same 'regulatory zone' as the Republic of Ireland for goods traded across the north-south border.  Today PM @BorisJohnson has set out a fair and reasonable compromise for replacing the backstop so we can get Brexit done by 31 October.    ➡️ https://t.co/V0Ay8MRmu3    Read the PM’s letter to the EU ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/JgFLpoNjUx — UK Prime Minister (@10DowningStreet) October 2, 2019  However, it would also stay in the same customs territory as mainland UK - not the Republic of Ireland, which is an EU member state. Therefore, checks would be necessary on some trade, both between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and between Northern Ireland and mainland UK.  On the crucial issue of physical infrastructure to conduct customs checks, which Brussels has ruled unacceptable in any deal agreed, the UK government concede their proposals would require a small number at traders’ premises.  “...UK and EU customs regimes taking place electronically, and with the small number of physical checks needed conducted at traders’ premises or other points on the supply chain.”  The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the Tory administration's key Northern Irish allies in government, have given their approval to Johnson’s plans for a renegotiated Brexit deal. They insist that the proposals are “entirely consistent with the spirit” of the Good Friday Agreement, the 1998 Northern Irish peace deal, and safeguard the UK’s internal market.

50,"The U.K. offered the European Union a proposed last-minute Brexit deal on Wednesday that it said represents a realistic compromise for both sides, as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged the bloc to hold “rapid negotiations towards a solution” after years of wrangling.",50," Interested in Brexit? Add Brexit as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Brexit news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest  With Britain due to leave the bloc at the end of this month, Johnson said in a letter to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker that not reaching a deal would be “a failure of statecraft for which we would all be responsible.” He did not mention that the EU and the U.K. did reach a deal in 2018 — only for it to be rejected, three times, by Britain’s Parliament.  The EU gave the proposals a guarded welcome and said the two sides would negotiate over the coming days. Juncker said he welcomed Johnson's ""determination"" to make progress but noted there were still some ""problematic"" areas. Finland, which currently holds the EU presidency, said the 27 other member states would “engage actively” with the U.K. proposals, and chief negotiator Michel Barnier said they represented “progress.”  The new proposals focus on maintaining an open border between the U.K.’s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland — the key sticking point to a Brexit deal. The U.K. proposes to do that by keeping Northern Ireland closely aligned to EU rules for trade in goods, possibly for an extended period.  The proposals, and Johnson’s letter, were conciliatory, despite having been billed by Johnson’s office as a take-it-or-leave it “final offer.”  Instead, Johnson used a speech to his Conservative Party to implore the bloc, and Britons, to end more than three years of acrimonious wrangling over the terms of the U.K.’s exit from the EU.  “Let’s get Brexit done,” was the repeated refrain to delegates at the conference in Manchester, northwest England.  British voters in 2016 narrowly chose to leave the EU but the country remains deeply divided over how to do it. In his speech, Johnson said people who voted for Brexit “are beginning to feel that they are being taken for fools."" He warned of “grave consequences for trust in our democracy” if Britain did not leave the EU on the scheduled date of Oct. 31.  He said the government was offering “constructive and reasonable proposals” to the EU.  The plan is “a compromise by the U.K. And I hope very much that our friends understand that and compromise in their turn,” Johnson said.  But the plan is likely to face deep skepticism from EU leaders, who will need to be convinced the U.K. has a workable proposal to avoid checks on goods or people crossing the Irish border.  A Brexit agreement between the EU and Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, was rejected by the U.K. Parliament, largely because of opposition to the ""backstop,"" an insurance policy designed to ensure there is no return to customs posts or other infrastructure on the Irish border.  An open border underpins both the local economy and Northern Ireland's peace process. But Johnson and other British Brexit supporters oppose the backstop because it would keep the U.K. tightly bound to EU trade rules in order to avoid customs checks — limiting the country's ability to strike new trade deals around the world.  Johnson insisted that “we will under no circumstances have checks at or near the border in Northern Ireland.""  The British proposal involves “an all-island regulatory zone on the island of Ireland, covering all goods including agrifood.” That would keep Northern Ireland in a regulatory zone with the EU for food, agricultural and industrial products, removing the need for checks.  The U.K. proposal does not put a time limit on that status, though it would have to be renewed every four years by the Northern Ireland Assembly. However, that assembly has been suspended for more than two years by a dispute between the main Unionist and Nationalist power-sharing parties.  Under the plan there would still need to be customs checks, but Johnson suggested they could be carried out away from the border at “other points on the supply chain.”  The Irish government said Prime Minister Leo Varadkar spoke to Johnson by phone on Wednesday. It said that while ""the proposals do not fully meet the agreed objectives of the backstop,"" Varadkar would ""study them in further detail.""  Johnson has vowed that Britain will leave on Oct. 31, with or without a Brexit deal.  In Wednesday’s speech he repeated his contention that the U.K. can handle any bumps that come from tumbling out of the bloc without a deal, which would mean the instant imposition of customs checks and other barriers between Britain and the EU, its biggest trading partner.  A no-deal Brexit is ""not an outcome we want ... (but) it is an outcome for which we are ready,"" he said.  But the U.K. government and businesses both say the disruptions would be substantial, with the flow of goods coming into Britain through the major Channel port of Dover cut in half.  Many lawmakers want to prevent a no-deal exit, and have passed a law that compels the government to seek a delay to Brexit if it can't get an agreement with the EU by Oct. 19. Johnson says he won’t do that — although he also insists he will obey the law. He has not explained how doing both will be possible.  Johnson also suffered a major setback when the U.K. Supreme Court ruled last week that his attempt to shut down Parliament for five weeks was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating Parliament’s ability to scrutinize the government’s Brexit plan.  The British government said Wednesday it will ask Queen Elizabeth II to suspend Parliament again next week — but just for a few days ahead of a speech on Oct. 14 laying out the administration’s plans. A short suspension of that kind is routine and usually happens about once a year.  Johnson, who has had a tumultuous 70 days in office, is eager to refocus attention away from Brexit. On Wednesday he delivered a speech peppered with puns, grand claims about Britain’s greatness and jokes at the expense of his opponents — chiefly left-wing Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, whom he dubbed a “communist cosmonaut.”  It was also, pointedly, a pre-election speech, with a grab-bag of promises: more money for hospitals and police, unspecified tax cuts, greener buses and faster internet access.  The brash Brexit champion is popular with many Conservatives, who welcome his energy and optimism after three years of Brexit gridlock under May. Some, though, have qualms about his personal conduct and his divisive tactics, which include using words like ""surrender"" and ""betrayal"" about opponents of Brexit.  He has been dogged by allegations that he handed out perks to a female friend's business while he was mayor of London and groped the thigh of a female journalist at a lunch two decades ago. Johnson denies impropriety in both cases.  The claims have not dented his popularity among many Conservatives.  “We don’t need Saint Boris, thank you,” said Jean Chesworth, a delegate from Newcastle-under-Lyme in central England. “We’re none of us saints. We can all look at the skeletons in our cupboards.”  ———  Kirka reported from London.

The EU has repeatedly rejected the proposals because they’re a bit slow and obviously didn’t understand them the first time, but senior figures within the party are confident that somebody new saying loudly saying ‘SPEAKEE ENGLISHEE’ will break the deadlock.  “The first time we explained the deal we’re after, Michel Barnier just cupped one ear and said ‘Que?’, so we think there’s room for movement there,” said MP Simon Williams.  ”All Boris has to do to make Parliament happy is get the deal we have been specifically told isn’t on the table – and he can do that by raising his voice and enunciating ev-er-y syl-lab-ble. Like that,” he said.  “If I were Prime Minister I would have done it by now. It would have been dead easy, but I know how to talk to foreigners as I holiday in the Peloponnese every year.”",1

25,Nigel Farage’s Brexit march proves nation cares more about Brackley Town vs Curzon Ashton than Brexit,25," March for Brexit Nigel Farage The people of Britain have spoken and made it clear that the result of Brackley Town vs Curzon Ashton is twice as important to them than any potential threat to Brexit.  Despite Nigel Farage’s march managing to secure the support and attendance of 0.0003% of the population, more than twice as many people attended Brackley’s home match against Curzon Ashton in the National League North division, with 450 turning out to show important it was.  Brackley secured a 2-0 victory in front of 250 more people than attended the start of Nigel Farage’s march, in the starkest illustration so far that Brexit no longer matters to anyone.  Farage himself spoke of the numbers, telling reporters, “What you have to remember is there would have been a million people here – like there was for the people’s vote march in London – if only the roads hadn’t been so busy due to immigration.  “Hard-working Brits who wanted to come out and support us today were unable to do so because of the Bulgarian plumber round the corner who keeps stealing their petrol money.  “Whereas the million people who turned up to support a people’s vote in London all had their petrol money paid for by George Soros, so it was easy for them.”  Reporters sent to cover the Brexit march said they were a little disappointed, given Nigel Farage had been pushing the event very heavily on social media.  As one TV reporter told us, “He said it would be the biggest protest in history, but there was a bigger queue outside my local Tesco when they made Heineken half-price just before Christmas.  “I’m not going to suggest that nobody cares about Brexit anymore, because that’s probably too big a leap, but people clearly don’t care what Nigel Farage says about Brexit any more.  “And no, of course he’s not doing the march himself. Have you learned nothing from this man in the last few years?”",1

The Boris plan unveiled today means Tariffs N to S meaning farms and agri food will be decimated. Also means 2 borders requiring renewal after 4 years, surveillance in border communities without their consent, checks N/S and W/E, no exemptions, no market access and import VAT.  In a pre-speech interview in the Sun, Johnson said he would look at any counteroffer made by the EU, but in his conference speech, there was no attempt to claim this was “the final offer”.    Johnson’s allies are privately conceding that what they send to Brussels is extremely unlikely to be accepted. But they also insist they’re not deliberately giving the European Union something they know they will reject out of hand, that would give them a convenient excuse to pursue no deal. Christopher Furlong / Getty Images  The preference, according to government sources, is for the European Union to engage in further talks over the next few days and see if a compromise can be found. They just can’t get a flat no.    At the same time, with all this going on — and MPs talking openly about the death threats they receive — there are grim warnings from “government insiders” about things worsening if there were a second referendum. Jeff J Mitchell / Getty Images Boris Johnson's senior adviser Dominic Cummings (centre) at the Tory party conference.  SO. That’s the first layer of all the scheming. Here’s the second: As things stand, the most likely outcome is that the UK and the EU do not reach an agreement. Tap to play or pause GIF Tap to play or pause GIF Tap to play or pause GIF Tap to play or pause GIF reddit.com  Now, Johnson has insisted that he won’t seek a Brexit delay by sending a letter to the EU requesting another extension. But if you remember, the so-called “Benn Act” passed by Parliament last month demanded that the government must send the extension letter if a deal is not agreed by Oct. 19. Johnson’s aides insist he will find a way of trying to prevent an extension by going “straight through” the Benn Act — that is, convincing the EU not to agree to an extension. Remember, the EU has said it would only agree to an extension if Johnson asked for it, and with a clear reason — for example, an election. And if Johnson doesn’t ask, he will likely end up in court.  That’s why many in government are privately urging the prime minister that he should do everything he can to show he doesn’t want to delay Brexit. If he can show that he was forced into it by Parliament and the courts, the thinking goes, he can agree only to a short delay.

While that is going on in Brussels, Johnson wants to suspend Parliament again so he can reopen a new session with a Queen’s Speech.

The next two weeks are likely going to lead to more lit, hold-onto-your-butts-Westminster moments which will ultimately decide whether or not the UK is actually leaving the EU on Oct. 31.

31,EU to grant year-long Brexit extension to give Britain the time to fully tear itself apart,31," Donald Tusk The EU is expected to grant the UK a year-long extension to Article 50 to allow time for the country to completely tear itself apart.  Prime Minister Theresa May had requested a short extension until late next month, but the EU seems unconvinced that would be enough time for Britain to completely implode.  The ERG responded furiously.  “This is typical of a tyrannical European superstate,” frothed whichever of the revolving door of red-faced maniacs is currently facing the challenge of stringing a coherent sentence together.  “We don’t need their year-long so-called extension!  “A month is more than enough time for this country to rip itself to shreds, and we can do it without the interference of Brussels, Thank you very much.  “The British people could tear themselves apart in an afternoon, given the opportunity. How dare the Europeans suggest it might take us longer than that.”  However, the EU has insisted that it sees the situation quite differently.  “It is clear that our friends in Britain need a little more time to bring their absurd, dysfunctional government to a complete standstill and take to the streets in an orgy of violence and retribution,” explained a sad Donald Tusk.  “Therefore, we will grant the extension for a full year. If, of course, the country reaches complete societal breakdown before then, that is good also.”  It is understood that The Prime Minister will make a comment to the press as soon as someone has explained to her what the EU is letting her country do next.",1
5,"Boris Johnson had already been labelled a disgrace for refusing to resign when the Supreme Court ruled he shut down Parliament illegally. But as MPs returned to work Wednesday, he managed to sink to a new low, invoking the name of a murdered MP in a way that sickened her widower.",5,"   In a fiery debate in the reconvened House of Commons, Labour MP Paula Sheriff called on Johnson to knock off the divisive, inflammatory rhetoric he’s adopted in pushing for Brexit, such as branding legislation intended to prevent a no-deal Brexit a “surrender act.”  Invoking the memory of the late Labour MP Jo Cox, who was murdered a week before the 2016 referendum by a far-right terrorist who yelled “death to traitors,” Sheriff said pro-Remain lawmakers were routinely targeted by extremist Brexiteers who echoed Johnson’s rhetoric of “betrayal” and “surrender” in their threats.  ""We should not resort to using offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language for legislation that we do not like, and we stand here under the shield of our departed friend with many of us in this place subject to death threats and abuse every single day,” said Sheriff, to applause from the Commons.  “We must moderate our language, and it has to come from the prime minister first.""  But if MPs had been looking for an inkling of remorse or self-reflection from Johnson, it wasn’t forthcoming. “I have to say, Mr Speaker, I've never heard such humbug in all my life,” he replied.  READ MORE: Bad news Boris: Supreme Court rules Johnson’s suspension of Parliament was illegal  Instead, the prime minister doubled down on the outrage, when Labour MP Tracy Brabin, who was elected in Cox's seat following her murder, repeated the call for Johnson to moderate his language, “so that we will all feel secure when we're going about our jobs.’  Johnson replied: “The best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and indeed the best way to bring this country together would be, I think, to get Brexit done.”  That comment drew gasps in the House, and a broad wave of condemnation. Cox’s widower, Brendan Cox, tweeted that the use of his late wife’s name made him “feel a bit sick.”  “The best way to honour Jo is for all of us (no matter our views) to stand up for what we believe in, passionately and with determination. But never to demonise the other side and always hold onto what we have in common,” he tweeted, adding that the left’s use of words like “coup” and “fascist” were also inflammatory.  Jo Swinson, leader of the pro-Remain Lib Dems, labelled Johnson’s comments “disgraceful,” and revealed she had been forced to call the police after receiving a death threat that targeted her child.  Labour MP Jess Phillips said that Johnson’s own language — that he would rather be found “dead in a ditch” than fail to bring about Brexit — had been used verbatim in a death threat aimed at her.  Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister, said she felt “disgust” at the prime minister, describing him as “untrustworthy, craven, [with] not a shred of concern for the consequences of his words or actions,” while newspaper the Daily Mirror labelled him the “man with no shame” on its front page.  The storm has rumbled on into Thursday for Johnson, revealing the depth of concern among pro-Remain lawmakers over the threats they have been facing for opposing the government’s strategy to take the country out of the EU by Oct. 31, deal or no deal.  READ MORE: Boris Johnson is so unpopular right now his own brother just quit  Opening the session Thursday, House Speaker John Bercow called on MPs to end the “toxic” culture in Parliament, describing the atmosphere Wednesday as “worse than any I’ve known in my 22 years in the house.”  “Please lower the decibel level and treat each other as opponents rather than enemies,” he said.  Speaking to the BBC Thursday morning, Sheriff said MPs were infuriated by Johnson’s casual dismissal of the consequences of his rhetoric.  “We talk about it in the tearooms. People are really frightened and for him to treat it almost like a joke, was absolutely horrific and demeans the office of prime minister,” she said.  “I believe the prime minister is inciting hatred towards MPs. I understand the importance of saying that, but I know that feeling is shared by many of us.”  Cover: Britain's Prime Minster Boris Johnson leaves 10 Downing Street for Parliament in London, Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2019.

60,Jeremy Corbyn finally joins Brexit debate to come down firmly on the side of making Jeremy Corbyn prime minister,60," Jeremy Corbyn wants to be prime minister A highly anticipated press conference by the Labour leader caused a seismic shock as Jeremy Corbyn ended two years of Brexit prevarication and finally declared that he would throw his full support behind a brilliant solution based on him moving into Downing Street.  He explained his plan to the gathered reporters, telling them,  “The Tories have failed to deliver on their promises. They have made a mess of Brexit. Labour’s plan will solve all the thorny questions by having me put a painting of Tony Benn in the Cabinet Office.  “We are certain that the question of the hard border in Northern Ireland can be solved by me offering a Miners Union banner to Lea Varadkar. All will be well when I am in charge.”  However, some doubts were raised as to Jeremy Corbyn’s ability to negotiate a better deal as explained Sigmund Wilhelms, the EU’s special commissioner on Brexit.  He told us, “Why does this man believe we will change our red lines for him? The truth is we really don’t care that much who is doing the negotiating.  “We think in terms of policies, funding and regulatory implications. You might also want to tell him that nearly all the key players in the EU are centre-right so trying to sway them by whistling the Red Flag is not the best tactic.  “Although if he does become PM please smarten him up. If he comes to Brussels looking like he does now, the security staff are just going to assume he’s a lonely widower trying to get out of the wind and give him some soup.  “He looks like he enjoys soup.”",1
12,Dame Margaret Beckett has declared she is willing to serve as a caretaker prime minister to stop Britain leaving the EU without a deal on October 31.,12," The Labour former foreign secretary has emerged as a leading choice among those plotting a government of national unity that would ask for a Brexit extension and then call a referendum or election.  MPs who want to stop a No Deal Brexit are considering ousting Boris Johnson from Downing Street through a vote of no confidence.  Dame Margaret Beckett has declared she is willing to serve as a caretaker prime minister to stop Britain leaving the EU without a deal on October 31  They would then seek to form a new government with the aims of delaying Brexit and holding either a second referendum or an election.  However, the group disagree on who should be caretaker prime minister.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has put himself forward but he has been rejected by Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, who has suggested an alternative figure such as Kenneth Clarke or Harriet Harman.  Former attorney general Dominic Grieve, one of 21 MPs stripped of the Tory whip, yesterday gave his backing to Dame Margaret and said he 'would be happy to serve in her administration'.  The Labour former foreign secretary has emerged as a leading choice among those plotting a government of national unity that would ask for a Brexit extension and then call a referendum or election  The Labour grandee last night said she believed it was 'extremely unlikely' and that nobody had 'discussed it seriously' with her.  But asked if she would refuse if asked to perform the role by MPs, she told The Evening Standard: 'Anybody who refused to serve in such circumstances would perhaps be unwise.'  However, Dame Margaret said she could not see a government of national unity 'working at all', adding: 'So I've not got excited about it in any way, shape or form but it's kind to think they have got a good opinion of me.  'It is very kind and very flattering - but to be perfectly honest it is not something I anticipate happening.'  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has put himself forward but he has been rejected by Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson  She stressed that she would prefer Mr Corbyn to get into Downing Street, saying: 'We already have a candidate for prime minister, thank you very much.'  Dame Margaret served as acting Labour leader for a couple of months in 1994 following the death of John Smith, but she lost out to Tony Blair in the subsequent leadership contest.  The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford yesterday suggested the party would be willing to back Mr Corbyn leading an interim government.  Ms Swinson has suggested an alternative figure such as Harriet Harman (pictured)  He told Sky News: 'It's not really about the individual, it is about the mechanism to create the election and Article 50.  'Under our constitution, it's right that the leader of the Opposition has the first opportunity to do that, and we would respect that as part of the process.  'We need to coalesce around an individual that can unite the Commons. We need to take our responsibilities to remove Boris from power and to make sure we have an election.",0
72,"“Me, me, me, me, me”: Boris Johnson clarifies position on Brexit",72," Boris on being prime minister Boris Johnson today clarified his stance on Brexit by insisting: “Me, me, me, me, me.”  The floppy-haired Conservative jester has told friends his principles on Europe will remain intrinsically linked to his chances of becoming Prime Minister.  And he said he remains confident rank-and-file Tories will continue to lap up his ‘loveable cad’ schtick, providing he impresses them with liberal use of Latin and references to Greek mythology.  “Boris’s beliefs have been consistent throughout his career,” said one aide close to the former foreign secretary.  “He believes, above all else, in his own destiny to become Prime Minister.”  Friends of Mr Johnson are now preparing for an inevitable leadership campaign and are understood to be considering the slogan ‘Vote for me, plebs, you know you want to’.  One member of the early-planning team said: “Boris wants a slogan that captures the essential truth that Tories in the shires will vote for him however scheming and self-serving he is shown to be.  “Other possibilities being considered include ‘Come On Ladies, Vote for Big Boris’ and ‘Vote Boris for Brilliant Jokes’.  “He hasn’t really thought beyond a snappy slogan so far and, to be honest, he probably won’t bother.  “Let’s be honest, he’s spent the last three years not bothering with any of the facts or details of Brexit, and lots of people still think he has all the answers.”  When asked by reporters outside his home for his reaction to Theresa May’s promise to resign, Johnson said: “Me, me, me, me, me.”",1
43,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Boris Johnson used his conference speech to stress his desire to ""get Brexit done""",43," The SNP want to ""bundle"" Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street to secure a new independence referendum in 2020, Boris Johnson has claimed.  The prime minister told the Tory party conference that the SNP may try to put the Labour leader in power to deliver fresh votes on independence and Brexit.  Nicola Sturgeon has said she is ""open-minded"" about replacing Mr Johnson with a caretaker prime minister.  Mr Johnson said more referendums would cause ""total national discord"".  The prime minister was speaking on the final day of the Conservative Party conference in Manchester.  Opposition parties have been meeting to discuss the possibility of forcing him from office via a confidence motion, with the SNP pushing for an early vote.  However parties have so far failed to unite behind this plan, with Mr Corbyn saying such a vote should only take place ""at a point we can win it and take no-deal off the table"".  Mr Johnson used his speech to attack the Labour leader's suitability for office, but said ""the SNP may yet try to bundle him towards the throne"".  Mr Johnson said the SNP had a ""programme for total national discord"" which would see 2020 taken up by ""the chaos and cacophony of two more referendums - a second referendum on Scottish independence, even though the Scottish people were promised that the 2014 vote would be a once in a generation decision - and a second referendum on the EU"".  He said the UK was ""the most successful political partnership in history"", and said he would ""defend"" the union ""against those who would want only destroy it"".  Image copyright PA Media Image caption Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon differ over Brexit and independence  Ms Sturgeon wants to hold a new referendum on independence in the second half of 2020, and her government has put forward legislation at Holyrood to facilitate this.  However the first minister wants to secure an agreement with the UK government before holding such a vote, to put it ""beyond legal challenge"".  The UK government has so far refused to consider such a deal, saying the issue was settled with the 2014 referendum.  Ms Sturgeon calls this position ""unsustainable"" and ""undemocratic"", and has said Scotland's ""right to choose independence"" will be ""right at the heart"" of her party's platform in the expected general election.  New Brexit proposals  Mr Johnson's speech came as the government delivered its new Brexit proposals to the EU, including plans to replace the Irish backstop.  The prime minister told the conference that the only alternative to his plan was no-deal. The European Commission has said it will ""examine [the proposals] objectively"".  The plan, outlined in a seven-page document, would see Northern Ireland stay in the European single market for goods, but leave the customs union - resulting in new customs checks.  The Northern Ireland Assembly would get to approve the arrangements first and vote every four years on keeping them.  Government sources say they believe they could enter an intense 10-day period of negotiations with the EU almost immediately, with the aim of coming to a final agreement at an EU summit on 17 October.  SNP MP Stephen Gethins said Mr Johnson's proposal was ""utterly unacceptable and yet another push towards a catastrophic No-deal exit"".  He added: ""It is clear that if Johnson pursues crashing out of the EU without a deal - hitting jobs, public services and people's livelihoods - then the blame will lie solely and squarely at the door of the Tory party.""  Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - long-term critics of the backstop and partners of the Conservative Party in Parliament - gave a cautious welcome to the proposals.  But Sinn Fein said the plans were a ""non-starter"", and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the deal was ""not acceptable"" and ""worse"" than Theresa May's agreement, as it ""undermined"" the Good Friday Agreement that secured peace in Northern Ireland.",0
21,"Theresa May ‘stuck in a time loop’, being forced to make the same Brexit offer over and over again",21," Theresa May Groundhog day Theresa May keeps waking up to find Parliament is forcing her to make the same Brexit offer every day.  So far Theresa has tried thousands of different ways to break the loop, including standing parliament in front of an oncoming train, trying to kill Boris Johnson and David Davis’ careers, and loading her and Jeremy Corbyn into the same vehicle and driving them off a cliff.  However, when she wakes up, she finds exactly the same story about deadlock on the Today Programme all over again.  “She’s going to have to keep doing this until she gets the perfect Brexit or forever, whichever comes first,” we were told.  ”We’re not sure how she came to be in this situation – possibly she was cursed by some villainous, pencilnecked Victorian wizard, or maybe she’s just been asked to achieve the impossible and reconcile at least six contradictory points of view.  “Having to keep telling John Humphries the same thing over and again despite knowing it’s futile must be some sort of personal hell.”  When asked how negotiations are going, Theresa May replied “I’ll give you a Brexit prediction. It’s going to be cold, it’s going to be grey & it’s going to last you the rest of your life.”",1
67,"I lied to Boris about voting Leave, because that’s what he would’ve wanted, insists Boris’ mum",67,"Boris Johnson's mum voted Remain Boris Johnson’s mum has admitted she lied to him about voting Leave because she thought that was the best way to get what she wanted, according to sources this afternoon.  After Johnson used his mother during his headline conference speech, telling delegates that she had voted Leave, his mum was quick to put the record straight by explaining, “No.”  She went on, “He asked how I voted and I considered telling him the truth, but honestly, Boris has always appreciated a good lie, ever since he was a little boy – so I told him a lie.  “I’m not an idiot, and neither is his Dad, sister or brother – we all voted Remain, but I really wanted a peaceful family dinner, and obviously the best way to get what you want is was to lie.  “No, I’ve no idea where Boris gets it from.  “His name’s not even Boris, it’s Dave – we just thought Boris suited him better when he got a bit older. But keep that to yourself, I think if we started telling the truth now it might trigger some sort of episode.”  Meanwhile, delegates inside the room have been left wondering why the news that an elderly white woman voted for Brexit is considered some sort of revelation.  As one explained, “It would be news if she had voted Labour, but an old middle-class lady voting to leave the EU is about as surprising as Boris lying to the queen or him not being able to name however many illegitimate children it is that he has now.  “Still, disappointing as it was, it was a million times better than Theresa’s.”",1

Former Justice Secretary David Gauke has said that next week could be MPs’ only opportunity to challenge a no-deal Brexit.  However, the man whose job it is to arrange business in the House of Commons claims that the agenda is already pretty full of vitally important items.  “Next week you say? Oooh…,” said Jacob Rees-Mogg as he gave the world’s most infuriating smirk. “That’s going to be tricky I’m afraid. Let’s see…  “Monday – oh we’re all still on holiday.  “Tuesday – we get back in the afternoon and then it’s prayers followed by new term drinks and nibbles.  “Wednesday is obviously Prime Minister’s Questions when Boris will waffle incoherently without giving a single sensible answer while we all jeer and laugh condescendingly at each other.

They want to introduce a heritage Bill to make all police officers say ‘Ullo, ullo, ullo, what’s all this then?’ whenever they turn up at a crime scene.  “As for Friday, well that’s the long-awaited Jaffa Cake Bill – the ‘cake or biscuit’ issue will be debated at length and the final decision enshrined in law once and for all.  “Don’t look at me like that – Jeremy Corbyn tabled that one.”",1
76,Britain sucking up to Donald Trump finally pays off as Scotch Whisky gets its very own US tariff,76," Donald Trump on scotch whisky Donald Trump built trust in his promise, that he would deliver a great deal to a post-Brexit Britain, after Scottish Single Malts were selected to be made even more exclusive in America, thanks to a 25% import tariff, whereas French Cognac and Irish Whiskey were completely left out of this special treatment.  While some distillers claimed this would hurt them, the UK government explained that the selection of Scottish Whisky for this honour was a great portent of Britain’s future relationship with the USA.  As explained Simone Williams, advisor to Liz Truss and spokesperson for the Department of International Trade.  She went on, “All the careful relationships nurtured by Liz Truss and Boris Johnson, not to mention the sterling work done by Liam Fox, have been validated as we understand Donald Trump personally intervened to put Scotch Whisky on the list of goods he finds so amazing they should have a luxury price.  “Notice how the Irish distillers and French champagne makers are not even on the list.  “And if we leave without a deal, that exclusivity will apply in Europe and in places that have FTA’s with the EU like Japan. Imagine people worldwide looking at prohibitively expensive bottles of whisky and wondering what mighty nation produces such a desirable product.”  Government sources claim that the news of the tariffs, and the prospect of joining a global market free of the shackles of EU free trade, led many Scottish distillers to celebrate in the traditional Highland way of sobbing quietly for an hour before checking what the insurance payoff is for a factory fire.",1
7,brexit countdown_bg Created with Sketch.,7," Remainer MPs are at loggerheads over whether they should try to strengthen an anti-No Deal law designed to force Boris Johnson to delay Brexit.  Under the so-called Benn Act passed at the start of the month Mr Johnson will have to go to Brussels on October 19 and beg for a three-month Article 50 extension if he has not agreed an exit deal with the EU by then.  But with the PM insisting Brexit will still happen on Halloween, with or without a deal, Remainers fear he is preparing to break the law.  Some are worried that the current legislation to force his hand might may not be strong enough and want to make it 'bulletproof'.  The Lib Dems are leading the charge and want to bring forward new rebel legislation which would force the PM to ask for a delay long before the middle of October - perhaps as early as next week.  But 21 ex-Tory MPs who were stripped of the party whip after backing the bid to block No Deal are against tampering with the existing law.  Instead they want to use the time between now and the October 19 deadline to hold the Prime Minister's feet to the fire in different ways.  Brexit Minister James Duddridge told the Commons this morning that the government would abide by what is on the statute book but insisted Mr Johnson remains committed to taking the UK out of the bloc on October 31.  'We will obey the law, but who knows what will happen between now and then in the negotiations,' Mr Duddridge said.  Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, said yesterday that she wants to toughen up an anti-No Deal law to force the PM to seek a Brexit delay as soon as next week  But 21 ex-Tory MPs like Rory Stewart (above, on GMB yesterday) are believed to be opposed to tampering with the legislation  Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson yesterday said that the UK could not wait until October 19, when the Benn Act - named after creator Labour MP Hilary Benn - says the PM must have asked the EU for a three-month extension if a No Deal split looks likely.  She said that there were fears that legal efforts to compel the PM to act might take longer than the period between the October 19 deadline and the Brexit departure date on Halloween.  Addressing the media outside Parliament yesterday, Ms Swinson argued that a 12-day buffer was not enough to safeguard against No Deal.  'We would argue that 12 days is not sufficient, particularly in line with a Prime Minister who has shown he is prepared to disobey the law,' she said, standing in front of Lib Dem MPs and peers.  'Even with the Supreme Court judgment, he has talked about disagreeing with it as if a Supreme Court judgment is something you can pick and choose whether or not it is right.  'That is why we have to bring forward the ways in which we can make sure the No Deal threat is removed.'  But Ms Swinson's plan appears doomed to fail after Labour responded coolly to the idea of changing the Benn Act.  'A lot of thought went into picking the date and it is not yet clear what problem the Libs are trying to fix,' a Labour source told The Telegraph.  However, there is growing dismay among some Remain-backing Labour MPs over Jeremy Corbyn's Brexit leadership.  Jeremy Corbyn, pictured in the House of Commons last night, is believed to be against the idea of changing the so-called Benn Act  One Labour MP said: 'It's humiliating. There's no leadership whatsoever. As usual he's present, but not involved.'  Meanwhile, the 21 Tory MPs who were stripped of the whip are also believed to be opposed to Ms Swinson's proposals.  They reportedly favour leaving the anti-No Deal law as it is and concentrating instead on ramping up the scrutiny of the PM's Brexit plans.  It is thought the 21 former Tories want to use parliamentary procedures and arcane devices to force the government to publish more details of its No Deal contingency planning and to keep the pressure on the PM with urgent questions and debates.  Such methods have proved productive for rebel MPs in the past as they have previously forced the government to hand over Brexit economic impact assessments and No Deal documents.",0
75,Boris secures supply of his favourite wine in event of no-deal Brexit,75," Boris Johson gets his wine covered in case of no deal New International Trade Secretary Liz Truss has announced that her department has secured supplies of Boris Johnson’s favourite wine in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  There had been concerns that Mr Johnson would have to tolerate an inferior wine from the South Coast of England, but happily, Ms Truss and her team have swung into action to ensure a ready stock of Chateau La Mission Haut-Brion for the foreseeable future.  “I am pleased to announce that there will be a constant supply of the Haut-Brion for Boris and his.. er.. companions to enjoy,” she confirmed earlier.  “It is due to no small effort by my team at International Trade, but I like to think that in securing the supply of Mr Johnson’s wine, it is one less problem for the nation to worry about.  “It is, after all, one thing for people to endure food and medicine shortages, it is quite another to imagine the Prime Minister suffer the indignity of drinking English wine.”  Boris supporters were thrilled at the news.  “Tremendous news,” said a Boris Johnson supporter, somewhat inevitably called Simon Williams.  “A real blow to those nay-sayers who say that Britain will be unable to endure a no-deal Brexit.  “I bet there are some pretty red-faces amongst those snowflakes now!”  It is understood that Ms Truss and her team’s next task will be to secure a ready supply of Boris’s favourite aged Manchego cheese and buffalo tomatoes.  Just as soon as supplies to keep Boris’s larder well-stocked have been secured, it is thought the department will start work on ensuring the nation doesn’t run out of toilet paper.",1
9,United Kingdom opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn will demand a general election as soon as a Brexit extension is secured from the European Union.,9," The Labour leader also pledged further action to ensure Prime Minister Boris Johnson asks for an extension, as demanded by the Benn Act passed in the days before Parliament was unlawfully suspended by Johnson. There has not been enough confidence on opposition benches that the prime minister would abide by that law.  ""It's not a matter of choice for him, it's an act of parliament that was passed. Last night, he seemed unable to give that undertaking (that he would obey the law),"" Corbyn told the PA news agency.  ""We will be taking parliamentary action on this again next week to ensure the prime minister does not crash us out of the EU on October 31 without a deal.""  That action would be to make demands on the prime minister to request the extension, but further discussions are to be held with the cross-party group on the specifics of the wording put before the legislature, he said.  Pressed on whether he would whip MPs to vote for an election the moment an extension is agreed, he said: ""Absolutely. Once we have agreed on the extension and carrying out the law of this country - at that point, and I made that very clear in my conference speech - we will support a general election.""  Anger sparked by Johnson  Johnson said on Thursday he needs to ""reach out"" to opposition MPs if he is to win their support in the Commons for a Brexit deal.  The prime minister said tempers need to ""come down"" after the angry scenes in the Commons on Wednesday.  However, he refused to apologise for describing the Benn Act, requiring him to seek a Brexit delay if he cannot get a new deal with the EU, as the ""surrender act"".  ""I need to reach out across the House of Commons,"" he told BBC South.  ""I think it is fair enough to call the surrender act what it is. I think it is absolutely reasonable. But we do need to bring people together, and get this thing done.  ""Tempers need to come down, and people need to come together because it's only by getting Brexit done that you'll lance the boil, as it were, of the current anxiety and we will be able to get on with the domestic agenda.""  'Toxic' parliament  Johnson had sparked fury on Wednesday as he doubled down on divisive rhetoric before storming out of the House of Commons chamber as MPs made impassioned appeals for him to dial down his language.  He had been begged by Paula Sheriff, a Labour MP, to cease using such terminology, referring to the murder of Jo Cox MP by a far-right Nazi sympathiser. She said the language being used in Parliament had consequences.  ""We should not resort to using offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language for legislation that we do not like and we stand here under the shield of our departed friend with many of us in this place subject to death threats and abuse every single day,"" said Sheriff.  190925134228605  ""And let me tell the prime minister that they often quote his words: surrender act, betrayal, traitor - and I for one am sick of it. We must moderate our language and it has to come from the prime minister first.""  She added: ""He should be absolutely ashamed of himself."" Her words prompted applause from the opposition benches.  Johnson replied: ""I have to say, Mr Speaker, I've never heard such humbug in all my life.""  The prime minister left the chamber shortly afterwards, before Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson described Johnson's words as ""sickening"", appearing to fight back tears as she revealed she had earlier reported to police a threat against her child.  Parliamentarians remained furious on Thursday, with more threats against them reported overnight. The office of Labour MP Jess Philips was attacked on Thursday afternoon, and a man arrested after reportedly attempting to kick the door down while yelling ""fascist"".  As the House of Commons reconvened, Speaker John Bercow told politicians to stop treating each other as enemies, saying the atmosphere in the legislature was the worst he had known since he was elected 22 years ago.  ""The culture was toxic,"" Bercow said in parliament.  And it was not just politicians who were angry. Johnson's own sister, Rachel, described her brother's words as a ""particularly tasteless"" way to refer to the memory of a murdered woman.  ""Words like 'collaborationist', 'traitor', 'betrayal'; my brother using words like 'surrender', 'capitulation', as if the people who are standing in the way of the blessed 'will of the people' - as defined by 17.4 million votes in 2016 - should be hung, drawn, quartered, tarred and feathered,"" she told Sky News. ""I think that it is highly reprehensible language to use.""  Strategy  Johnson's combative strategy appears straightforward: ridicule Parliament as a bunch of weaklings wedded to the EU and unwilling to follow ""the people's mandate"" to pull the country out of the world's largest trading bloc.  He may not be able to make good on his promise to make Brexit happen on October 31, but he has positioned himself for the inevitable election ahead so he can blame Parliament - and the EU's supposed intransigence - for keeping the UK within the EU.  While Johnson is setting the stage for a ""people-versus-parliament"" election, the reality is the nation remains deeply split over the wisdom of leaving the EU, and the debate has become ever more shrill and angry, particularly after the UK's Supreme Court unanimously declared earlier this week that the prime minister acted illegally in suspending Parliament for five weeks.  Johnson suffered yet another setback on Thursday after MPs rejected his call to briefly suspend their business for the Conservative Party's conference, highlighting the hostility he faces in a Parliament that he is unable to lead or govern.  He has now lost all seven parliamentary votes he has faced since taking power.",0
53,"Boris Johnson (right) and Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission. Getty",53," Boris Johnson will submit his ""final offer"" to the European Union on Wednesday.  The prime minister is set to publish details of his proposed Brexit deal after addressing Conservative party conference this afternoon.  Johnson has called for the backstop to be scrapped and replace with a new arrangement for managing the Irish border.  Details of Johnson's plan were revealed on Tuesday evening. They involve creating two borders and new checks on goods moving in and out of Northern Ireland.  A senior Irish minister said the reported plan was unacceptable.  Visit Business Insider's home page for more stories.  LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson will on Wednesday submit to the European Union his ""final offer"" on a Brexit deal as the United Kingdom approaches the October 31 cliff-edge.  Johnson will address Conservative party conference in Manchester, England before revealing the details of his proposal for managing the border between the Northern Ireland and Ireland after the UK has left the EU.  The question of how to preserve the status quo on the island of Ireland — primarily how to avoid checks and infrastructure on the border — has led to a stand-off between Johnson's UK government and the EU.  Under law passed last month, Johnson must secure parliamentary approval for a Brexit with deal with EU by mid-October, or request a fresh delay to the UK's exit through an extension to Article 50.  However, the prime minister has said he will not delay Brexit.  So what is Johnson's big offer?  The details of Johnson's offer to the EU were revealed by The Telegraph on Tuesday evening.  The prime minister on Tuesday described the offer as ""fair and reasonable.""  The key points of the prime minister's reported offer are that after the transition period, which would end in December 2020, the whole of the UK would leave the customs union, including Northern Ireland. However, Northern Ireland would continue to follow swathes of EU single market rules for at least another four years. After those four years end, its politicians would decide whether to either continue following EU rules, or converge with the rest of Great Britain.  In practice, this would mean:  Two new borders: a customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and a regulatory border in the Irish sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  A myriad of new checks on goods moving in and out of Northern Ireland.  This arrangement would be time-limited, creating a new cliff-edge in the mid-2020s.  Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, that props up the Conservative government in Westminster, would effectively have the power to veto continued alignment with the EU.  Numerous experts said the proposal was unviable, with Peter Foster, the journalist who revealed its details, describing it as ""extraordinary"" and adding: ""I cannot for the life of me see how this flies; or could ever be intended to fly.""  The proposal falls short of upholding the commitment made by the UK government when it was led by Theresa May, to make sure there are no physical checks on the island of Ireland whatsoever as a result of Brexit.  Jonathan Powell, who represented the UK government in Northern Ireland peace talks, said the proposals were ""not serious"" and indicated that Johnson was actually trying to avoid an agreement with the EU so no deal takes place.  And Helen McEntee, the Irish government's Minister for European Affairs, said the proposals were ""unacceptable"" as they breached the UK government's previous commitment to avoid physical checks on the island of Ireland.  Read more: These business owners on the Irish border fear a no-deal Brexit could soon wreck their livelihoods  Read more: 'The guns are back out again': Northern Ireland fears a Brexit border will escalate violence  However, Johnson will on Wednesday use his party conference speech to describe his offer as the only route to avoiding a no-deal Brexit on October 31, and repeat his promise not to delay Brexit.  The prime minister is expected to say: ""What people want, what Leavers want, what Remainers want, what the whole world wants — is to move on,"" he is expected to say.  ""I am afraid that after three-and-a-half years people are beginning to feel that they are being taken for fools.""  Pro-EU campaigners accused Johnson of looking for an ""excuse"" to deliver a no-deal Brexit.  ""Such a damaging idea isn't meant to create a breakthrough. By cutting away safeguards for the Good Friday Agreement, there's no doubt the government is looking for the EU to reject it,"" Naomi Smith, CEO of anti-Brexit group Best For Britain, told Business Insider.  ""This is not a sincere proposal. They want the EU to reject it so they have an excuse to force our country into a damaging no-deal Brexit, risking food and medicine shortages.""  ""These games only damage Britain's reputation on the world stage.""",0
59,brexit countdown_bg Created with Sketch.,59," The Pound has risen against the Dollar after Boris Johnson gave a barnstorming speech at the Tory conference calling for no more delays to Brexit.  The Prime Minister addressed Conservatives in Manchester today and tore into Remainer MPs, describing Parliament as a 'pebble in the shoe' of the nation.  He again made clear that he will not beg Brussels for an extension - suggesting the EU must accept his new 'compromise' proposals or face No Deal.  Despite his threats of a No Deal, which economists have claimed would be a disaster for the British economy, the Pound experienced a surge following Boris's speech.  Currency data shows the Pound shot up against the US Dollar from 1.2254 at 12.41pm to 1.2296 at 12.53pm.  The surge is some comeback for the Pound, which fell to 1.1199 against the Euro yesterday when Boris announced his 'final' Brexit deal, but is now at 1.1240.  In his keynote speech at the Conservative Party conference Mr Johnson insisted his plan to replace the Irish backstop would 'in no circumstances' result in checks at or near the border in Northern Ireland.  Shortly after his speech, the Pound shot up against the US Dollar from 1.2254 at 12.41pm to 1.2296 at 12.53pm  Addressing party conference for the first time as PM, Mr Johnson again made clear that he will not beg Brussels for an extension - saying they must choose between his new 'compromise' plan and No Deal  Mr Johnson said: 'Today in Brussels we are tabling what I believe are constructive and reasonable proposals which provide a compromise for both sides.  'We will under no circumstances have checks at or near the border in Northern Ireland. We will respect the peace process and the Good Friday agreement.  'And by a process of renewable democratic consent by the executive and assembly of Northern Ireland we will go further and protect the existing regulatory arrangements for farmers and other businesses on both sides of the border.  'And at the same time we will allow the UK - whole and entire - to withdraw from the EU, with control of our own trade policy from the start.'  Mr Johnson acknowledged the plan represented a 'compromise by the UK'.  'I hope very much that our friends understand that and compromise in their turn,' he told the Manchester conference.  'Because if we fail to get an agreement because of what is essentially a technical discussion of the exact nature of future customs checks, when that technology is improving the whole time, then let us be in no doubt that the alternative is no deal.  'That is not an outcome we want. It is not an outcome we seek at all.  The surge is some comeback for the Pound, which fell to 1.1199 against the Euro yesterday when Boris announced his 'final' Brexit deal, but is now at 1.1240  Mr Johnson was embraced by girlfriend Carrie after giving his keynote speech in Manchester this afternoon  'But ... it is an outcome for which we are ready.'  British officials have made clear to EU counterparts that the legal texts being presented to the European Union are a final offer and unless Brussels is prepared to engage there will be no more talks until after Brexit.  The plan involves a 'two borders for four years' measure that will leave Northern Ireland in a relationship with Europe until 2025, according to The Daily Telegraph.  It accepts the need for both a regulatory border between Britain and Northern Ireland in the Irish Sea for four years and customs checks between the North and the Irish Republic.  Ireland's deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, speaking late on Tuesday night, said this was 'no basis for an agreement' and 'concerning to say the least'.  Mr Johnson will speak to European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday afternoon to discuss the Prime Minister's Brexit plan.  The commission said it will not 'pre-empt any reaction' before having a chance to study the proposals to replace the backstop.  Mr Johnson told the conference 'we can, we must and we will' get Brexit done.  Despite the 'Surrender Bill' - the legislation passed into law aimed at blocking the Prime Minister from taking the UK out of the EU without a deal unless he has the consent of MPs - Mr Johnson insisted he would meet the October 31 deadline 'come what may'.",0
55,Image copyright AFP/Getty Images,55," The government has delivered its new Brexit proposals to the EU, including plans to replace the Irish backstop.  The plan, outlined in a seven-page document, would see Northern Ireland stay in the European single market for goods, but leave the customs union - resulting in new customs checks.  The Northern Ireland Assembly would get to approve the arrangements first and vote every four years on keeping them.  The European Commission said there had been progress but ""problems"" remained.  Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said the new blueprint did not ""fully meet the agreed objectives of the backstop"", in terms of upholding the EU's single market, protecting peace in Northern Ireland and supporting economic co-operation with the Republic of Ireland.  But he said he wanted an agreement and talks would continue.  The UK is set to leave the EU on 31 October and the government has insisted it will not negotiate a further delay beyond the Halloween deadline.  Speaking at the Conservative Party conference earlier on Wednesday, Boris Johnson said the only alternative to his Brexit plan was no-deal.  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption PM: Boris Johnson: ""It (no deal) is not an outcome we want... but is an outcome for which we are ready""  In a letter to European Commission's president, Jean-Claude Juncker, the prime minister said the new proposals ""respect the decision taken by the people of the UK to leave the EU, while dealing pragmatically with that decision's consequences in Northern Ireland and in Ireland"".  Government sources hoped the UK might be able to enter an intense 10-day period of negotiations with the EU almost immediately, with the aim of coming to a final agreement at an EU summit on 17 October.  Mr Juncker welcomed what he said were ""positive advances"" in some areas but he said the UK's proposed system of ""governance"" of the new arrangements was ""problematic"" - and customs rules remained a concern.  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier: ""There is progress, but to be frank, lots of work still needs to be done""  Don't expect the EU to rush to reject the prime minister's proposals even though there are elements that clearly contravene EU red lines, such as the implementation of any kind of customs procedures between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  Jean-Claude Juncker spoke today of ""concerns"" arising from the text but EU leaders won't want to be seen to be the ones closing the door to a deal.  Throughout the Brexit process they've repeatedly kicked the ball back into the UK government's court.  On cue, leaders are ""welcoming the delivery of the proposals from the government"" and inviting the prime minister to continue negotiations.  The fundamental questions for the EU remain: How much does does the prime minister really want a deal? Is he willing to move from his apparent ""take it or leave it"" position?  If he is, there will be something to talk about. If not, the EU will try its best to avoid being the ones to say ""forget it"".  But Mr Johnson should think again if he imagines his proposals, which do include concessions from his side, will prompt EU countries with a lot to lose in a no deal Brexit (like Germany) to try to force Ireland to accept his offer.  Angela Merkel today insisted EU leaders would stick together. With such an important EU member leaving, Mrs Merkel believes unity amongst those left behind is paramount.  Arlene Foster, leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, supported the plan, saying it would allow Northern Ireland to leave the customs union and single market at the same time as the rest of the UK.  Several Conservative MPs who opposed Theresa May's agreement also signalled their likely support, with leading Brexiteer Steve Baker saying he was ""cautiously optimistic"".  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption DUP leader says new proposals ""sensible and serious""  But Sinn Fein said the plans were a ""non-starter"" and accused the DUP, their former power-sharing partners of ""working against the interests of the people"" of Northern Ireland.  And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the deal was ""not acceptable"" and ""worse"" than Theresa May's agreement, as it ""undermined"" the Good Friday Agreement that secured peace in Northern Ireland.  What is in the proposals?  The prime minister has set out details of his plan to replace the Irish border ""backstop"" in the current Brexit agreement.  The backstop is the controversial ""insurance policy"" that is meant to keep a free-flowing border on the island of Ireland but which critics - including the PM - fear could trap the UK in EU trading rules indefinitely.  Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU:  Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021  But Northern Ireland would, with the consent of politicians in the Northern Ireland Assembly, continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products - what he calls an ""all-island regulatory zone""  This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years  Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks  These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain""  The government is also promising a ""New Deal for Northern Ireland"", with financial commitments to help manage the changes.  Image caption Mr Johnson has written to the European Commission president about his proposals  German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has spoken to Mr Johnson, said the EU would study the proposals carefully.  She said she ""trusted"" the bloc's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier to maintain European unity.  But opponents of Brexit in Parliament indicated they would not support the proposals, unless they were accompanied by the promise of another referendum.  The Liberal Democrats, who want to stop Brexit, said the proposals would deal a ""hammer blow"" to the Northern Irish economy.  The Scottish National Party dismissed the proposals as ""window dressing"".",0
61,‘Principled’ Brexiters promise to vote for deal they think is terrible as long as their boss promises to resign,61," Principled Brexiters Senior Brexit-backing MPs last night proved their love for Britain by promising to vote for a deal they think is bad for the country if it furthers their careers.  ERG members including Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg demonstrated their unshakable principles by offering to vote for something they have twice opposed as long as their boss resigns.  Johnson, who had already shown his suitability for leadership by having a natty haircut, made another impressive statement of his credentials by quoting the Bible in the Daily Telegraph – although he oddly missed out the bit about not committing adultery.  And Rees-Mogg proved he is a man of the people by giving one of his nannies a Sunday off and turning a crucial meeting on the future of the country into Bring Your Child to Work Day.  “These men are giants of modern politics and the future of government,” said an ERG insider after a group of hardline Brexiteers including Johnson and Rees-Mogg held meetings with the Prime Minister at Chequers.  “They are so committed to the good of the nation that they are prepared to cast their vote for the Prime Minister over a withdrawal agreement they have twice rejected as bad for Britain.  “Because really what is important for the country is that these posh blokes are in charge of whatever post-Brexit wasteland they help to create.  “It is what they were born to and what they are entitled to.”  Supporters of a softer Brexit expressed surprise at news of the meeting between the PM and a selection of Tory caricatures.  One senior campaigner said: “I only made a quick trip to the garden centre on Sunday so I would have loved a visit to Chequers.  “But maybe the PM has lost all the numbers from her phonebook apart from the ones marked ‘madmen’.  “That can be the only explanation for the meeting – either that or she’s more bothered about the party than the country”.",1
70,Brexit 50p coin already worth only 20p,70," Brexit 50p released The commemorative 50p coin that Sajid Javid is hoping to release in time for Brexit is already worth only 20p, according to economists.  The coin, which will be issued to mark the UK’s departure from the European Union on 31st October, and will seek to forever remind the British population of that glorious moment it took a metaphorical shotgun to both feet, will look like a normal 50p but will also have a daft platitude inscribed on it.  According to reports, the coin will feature the Queen’s head and the date 31 October 2019 and on the reverse the phrase “Friendship with all nations”, which presumably is an intentionally ironic reference to Britain sticking two fingers up at every country it has ever been good friends with over the last twenty years.  Economist Simon Williams explained, “The chancellor has made a shrewd move in choosing the 50p coin as the value with which to make a commemorative Brexit coin, as it can’t drop too much value, worst case – each one loses 50p, which isn’t the end of the world.  “With a deal with the EU now a dwindling possibility, the value of the coin is currently around 20p, but in the event of a no deal situation, the value could drop to 10p, or even lower if we crash out in acrimonious circumstances.  “And Mr Javid will be thankful that it’s currently valued at 20p, that’s actually quite a ringing endorsement of his government.”  It is understood that the coin will be blue in colour, as that sort of thing seems to please some of the population.",1
74,Jeremy Corbyn responds to renewed threat of no-deal Brexit with marathon jam-making session,74," Jeremy Corbyn allotment Jeremy Corbyn has responded to Boris Johnson’s threat to take Britain out of the EU without a deal with a commitment to finish making three dozen jars of strawberry jam by this weekend.  The jam, which Corbyn described as a central plank of his policies, is currently setting in jars on his counter-top – meaning the Labour Leader is tragically unavailable to table a no-confidence motion in the new Prime Minister.  Corbyn is understood to be ‘fully committed’ to taking the jam out of the large stewing pot on his hob, and dismissed suggestions that he might find more constructive things to do with his time.  “As part of his firm pledge to listen to both party members and the people of Britain about the things which matter to them most, Jeremy has announced a wide-ranging consultation into whether they prefer pickle or chutney with their sandwiches,” a Labour spokesman told us.  “This follows his hard-hitting campaign earlier this year to ensure those little paper circles you put on the top of the jar are made from recycled materials.  “Voters can rest safe in the knowledge that the party leader will spend the summer recess fighting for them and their rights from the comfort and safety of his shed, when he’s not busy making some of his trademark preserves.”  The spokesman went on to describe any suggestion that Corbyn is an utterly hopeless waste of space as ‘smears from Conserve-atives’.",1
79,No-deal Brexit rehearsal ‘goes well’ as 87 trucks successfully drive straight over a Dover cliff,79," Brexit truck trial A live rehearsal of an emergency traffic system to be rolled out in the event of no-deal Brexit has gone ‘pretty well’ a Department for Transport spokesperson has confirmed.  The ‘war game scenario’ developed by the DfT saw 87 trucks meet at a disused airport before starting their journey to Dover, where they were directed en-masse to drive straight over the White Cliffs.  The wreckage of dozens of smouldering trucks has been declared ‘par for the course’, and a good omen for the weeks ahead as the parliamentary Brexit vote is scheduled for next week.  A DfT spokesperson confirmed, “The test went as well as can be expected, given this is something only morons are in favour of.  “The trucks caused no real tailbacks to other road users, and they were able to drive straight off the cliff smoothly and without delay.”  Brexit supporter Simon Williams welcomed the trial run, insisting that British lorries can throw themselves off a cliff as well as any European counterpart.  He went on, “The only thing wrong with the exercise was that there was nothing written on the side of the trucks about how great Brexit is going to be.”  Those who have voiced concerns over the capacity of the disused Airport found they were also quickly dismissed by the DfT.  The spokesperson continued, “We’ve heard people suggest that Manston Airfield can only hold 6,000 vehicles, nowhere near the number expected to drive over the cliff in the event of a no-deal.  “We can, however, confirm that we have contingency plans to use both Gatwick and Heathrow which we assume will no longer be needed either.”",1
65,Ramsgate declared ‘Brexit Capital’ due to being home to Seaborne Freight and UK’s largest Wetherspoon,65," Ramsgate Brexit capital The coastal town of Ramsgate, Kent, has been named ‘Brexit Capital of Britain’ after perfectly encapsulating everything about Britain’s split from the EU.  The town, where the dozens and dozens of shiny new Seaborne Freight cargo and passenger ferries are currently moored in all their glory, is also home to the largest branch of regular Brexiteer watering hole, Wetherspoon.  Brexit Secretary for the current week, Stephen Barclay, made the announcement today, saying, “The wonderful town of Ramsgate beautifully represents all that is marvellous about Brexit.  “Although I have never been there, obviously, I expect it looks like it is still living in those halcyon days of post-war Britain, with quaint little ice cream shops and foreigners being verbally abused outside a high street branch of Wilkinsons.  “If the operators of Seaborne Freight chose Ramsgate in which to start-up a multi-million pound business and get it all up and running in the space of two months, then that says a lot about the spirit of the town itself.”  He went on, “Then after a hard day’s work operating an efficient ferry service from a port that easily rivals Dover, where better to refresh oneself than in The Pavilion, Britain’s largest Wetherspoons pub.  “There is not a place on this island you can stand that will make you more proud to be British.”  Ramsgate resident Simon Williams responded, “No sign of a ferry here, mate. But he’s right about ‘Spoons. It’s massive, and there’s nowhere better to have a drunken brawl in the whole of Kent.”",1
18,A defiant Boris Johnson last night vowed that he would not be 'bullied' into moderating his language as his most senior adviser accused MPs facing abuse of bringing it on themselves.,18," The Prime Minister faced a backlash after he repeatedly used the phrase 'Surrender Act' in a Commons debate to describe legislation passed by rebel MPs to block a No Deal Brexit.  But yesterday he pledged to keep using the term as he warned that 'people will feel very badly let down' if the country does not leave the EU on October 31.  The PM's top aide Dominic Cummings last night said MPs should not be surprised about the level of anger directed towards them following the repeated delays to Brexit.  Boris Johnson has refused to be bullied into moderating his language in the House of Commons  118 Church of England archbishops and bishops condemns MPs 'unacceptable' language Every archbishop and bishop in the Church of England has condemned the language used by MPs as ‘unacceptable’. In a joint statement, the 118 members of the College of Bishops said: ‘In the last few days the use of language, both in debates and outside parliament, has been unacceptable. ‘We should speak to others with respect… We should not denigrate, patronise or ignore the honest views of fellow citizens but seek to respect their opinions, their participation in society, and their votes’. The bishops acknowledged they were ‘conscious of the great challenges MPs face’ but urged for ‘respect on all sides amid growing acrimony.’ The Archbishop of Canterbuty, the Most Rev Justin Welby, told The Times: ‘The foundations of our unity and way of life are being challenged. ‘There needs to be a cooling of tempers on all sides in order to enable people to try to come to an agreement to see what solution can unite the country and do what has to be done.’ This is not the first time the church has intervened on Brexit. In August this year, a group of 25 bishops wrote an open letter warning of the dangers of leaving the European Union without a deal. In it signatories, including the Bishop of London and the Bishop of Manchester, said: ‘Our main social and political priority must be to leave well, paying particular attention to the impact of political decisions on those most vulnerable.’  'A lot of people in Parliament are more out of touch with the country now than they were in summer 2016,' he told an event in London. 'If you're a bunch of politicians and you say we are going to respect the result of a democratic vote, and then after you lose you say, 'We don't want to respect that vote', what do you expect to happen?'  Mr Cummings said there was a 'very important distinction' between 'robust political discussion and threats of violence', which he condemned.  'Threats of violence are a completely different matter... everyone should take those extremely seriously,' he added.  Asked whether he believes MPs have themselves to blame for the abuse they are receiving, Mr Cummings replied: 'That's the way you're putting it. I am using my language.'  Mr Johnson faced fury on Wednesday night after he dismissed as 'humbug' a complaint by a Labour MP that his 'inflammatory' rhetoric risked provoking attacks on MPs.  He further angered the opposition by suggesting that the best way to honour murdered Labour MP Jo Cox – an ardent Remainer – was to 'get Brexit done'. Former Tory premier Sir John Major yesterday accused the PM of 'wilfully' destroying the prospects of any cross-party agreement on Brexit with his Commons onslaught.  He said Mr Johnson was whipping up 'fear and anger' for electoral purposes – a tactic he described as 'profoundly un-Conservative'. Mr Johnson defended himself in a round of interviews with BBC regional news programmes, saying: 'I do think in the House of Commons it is important I should be able to talk about the 'Surrender Bill' in the way that I did.  'It would take away the power of this Government and the power of this country to decide how long it would remain in the EU and give that power to the EU. That's really quite an extraordinary thing.'  The PM's top aide Dominic Cummings last night said MPs should not be surprised about the level of anger directed towards them following the repeated delays to Brexit  Mr Johnson said he believes that 'tempers need to come down', but accused opposition MPs of using more abusive terms than him in the Commons chamber.  'I was sitting opposite people who were shouting all sorts of things at me all afternoon that were far harsher,' he said.  'What I worry about is if we don't get Brexit done, then people will feel very badly let down – and that's why we've gotta bash on and get it done on October 31.  'It's only by getting Brexit done that you'll lance the boil...of the current anxiety.'  In a meeting of Tory MPs earlier, Mr Johnson said the party would not be 'bullied' into toning down its language.  Commons Speaker John Bercow yesterday pleaded with MPs on all sides to tackle the 'toxic' political culture  However, Labour MPs have warned the 'horrendous' language about Mrs Cox could scupper Mr Johnson's chances of getting a Brexit deal through Parliament. A number of pro-Leave Labour MPs are known to have been considering voting for any agreement he strikes as they are so worried by the prospect of No Deal. But shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Mr Johnson's performance in the Commons chamber on Wednesday had put off colleagues from offering cross-party support.  'I have spoken to people who might want to consider a Boris Johnson deal but that is over,' she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  Commons Speaker John Bercow yesterday pleaded with MPs on all sides to tackle the 'toxic' political culture.  He said of the angry exchanges on Wednesday evening: 'There was an atmosphere in the chamber worse than any I've known in my 22 years in the House. On both sides passions were inflamed, angry words uttered – the culture was toxic.'",0
64,Latest Brexit plan for Boris to squeeze Barnier’s thigh under the negotiating table in attempt to get deal,64," Boris to grope Barnier The Prime Minister will avoid a further extension to the Brexit deadline by going to Brussels and doing what he does best – letting his wandering hands work their magic.  Details of the UK’s proposals for reaching a Brexit deal have been revealed – the Prime Minister is all set to sexually assault Michel Barnier.  “The PM knows exactly what Barnier wants, and he’s man enough to give it to him,” said a Downing Street spokesman.  “Theresa was never bold enough, but Boris has no such inhibitions.”  The Prime Minister suggested that all this Irish backstop nonsense was simply part of a prolonged mating ritual.  “Michel, my belle,” he said. “What a tease he is! He’s been playing hard to get but he’s absolutely gagging for it – I have an excellent nose for these things.  “Barnier normally starts negotiating sessions by sitting opposite me so I’ll start off with a classic bit of footsie. That will encourage him to move seats after the coffee break and take his place by my side.  “As everyone knows, sitting next to somebody is another way of saying, ‘touch me anywhere you like big boy!’  “And I will! I’ll squeeze his juicy thigh through the deliciously tight trousers he always wears especially for my benefit. His crotch will be my oyster!  “I’ll negotiate him like he’s never been negotiated before – he’ll get a satisfying deal all right.  “Hootchie cootchie!”",1
77,Most Brexiters planning to blame any consequence of No Deal Brexit on Sadiq Khan,77," Sadiq Khan blamed for Brexit As Boris Johnson refuses to negotiate with the EU and the prospect of No Deal becomes very real, leave supporters are relishing the prospect of blaming any economic downturn on the Mayor of London.  Speaking from the Croydon Wetherspoons where he whittles away the day, retired fishmonger and full-time arsehole Simon Williams, explained that he was already practising holding Sadiq Khan responsible for any ill effects of the policy he supports.  “I’ll be honest, I’ve nearly given up claiming No Deal will be a piece of piss. I thought it would only fuck over my smug children for being smarter than me, but I’ve just realised that my yearly holiday in Benidorm could be more expensive. That and the wife’s insulin supply could be a problem.  “But I believe in British pluck. We will just have to take the hardships and use them to attack that Muslim snowflake who is making kids stab each other through sharia magic or something. When the shelves run bare, I will bang on incessantly that Sadiq Khan needs to stop being so PC and get it sorted.”  Mr Williams also explained that the act of blaming every ill of the world on a high profile British Muslim was a safety blanket in uncertain times.  “Everything is confusing nowadays. I used to be a Farage man but now I have another philandering money-grubbing racist to slavishly follow in the shape of Boris Johnson. No one has any idea of what tomorrow will bring.  “But whatever happens, I have the safety of knowing I can spout off about how every last one of society’s problems is the fault of a brown man that scares me.”",1
47,"Giving the keynote speech to his Conservative party's annual conference in Manchester, England, the British Prime Minister told a packed conference hall that deal or no deal, the UK is ""coming out of the EU on October 31, come what may.""",47," So far, so predictable -- and the audience of party activists and lawmaker duly lapped it up. Johnson, after all, is the man who will ""get Brexit done.""  But his language on Britain's broader relationship with Europe was markedly softer. ""This is not an anti-European party and it is not an anti-European country. We love Europe,"" he sad. The response from the conference hall was decidedly muted. ""Well, I do, anyway,"" he muttered.  Whatever the reaction to Johnson in Manchester, it doesn't change the scale of the challenge he faces both in Westminster and Brussels.  Johnson later published a letter to the EU Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, setting out plans for a new Brexit deal, the existing one having been rejected three times in Parliament. Downing Street briefed before the speech that this would be a ""final"" offer to the EU. If Brussels doesn't like it, Johnson said in his speech that the UK is perfectly ready for no deal.  It's currently unclear if Brussels will engage with the plans. Johnson's letter is vague and, on first reading, still might breach some of the EU's red lines.  So, what is the Prime Minister up to?  The truth is that the PM is politically stuck. He wants to get a Brexit deal, but one that makes him look like he forced Brussels to back down. It needs it to be soft enough that opposition lawmakers will vote for it in the House of Commons, but firm enough that it's not seen as a sellout by his own hardline Brexiteers.  He also needs to signal to voters that he has done everything in his power to drag Brexit over the line, while demonstrating to Brexit moderates that he hasn't been irresponsible.  All of which explains why Johnson simultaneously professes that no-deal is ""not an outcome we seek at all,"" yet ""it is an outcome for which we are ready,"" accompanied by a plan that is unacceptable to the EU.

MUST WATCH Boris Johnson tells opponents to hold no-confidence vote 02:41  The PM trying to speak out of both sides of his mouth because he thinks an election is coming. And that election might come after he is forced to request an extension to the Article 50 process and delay Brexit.  While Johnson would much prefer an election after Brexit is done, it might not be up to him. Legislation has been passed by Johnson's opponents in Parliament to demand that he requests an extension, should no deal be agreed between the UK and the EU. Should he choose to ignore that law, he could be faced with legal problems that are unprecedented for a sitting Prime Minister -- even one who was recently slapped down by the UK Supreme Court.  Yet, despite Johnson saying he would rather be ""dead in a ditch"" than delay Brexit, it might not be so bad to be dragged kicking and screaming across that ditch by meddlesome judges. It would give Johnson an easy election campaign in which he could present himself as the only major party leader that wants to deliver Brexit. If he gets a majority, it's a done deal.  We will soon find out the precise details of the Johnson Brexit plan and whether it really is a final offer or a shock tactic designed to force the EU into further talks.  ""Unless the proposals are a starting point, it's very hard to see both sides going into a tunnel to try and finalize a deal,"" says Mujtaba Rahman, managing director of the Eurasia Group think tank. ""If this is indeed the final offer, it's very hard to see a landing zone between the two sides.""  If the EU is not willing to negotiate, Johnson will be pressurized hard to request that Brexit extension. Johnson can then march around the UK and legitimately claim to be the only political big beast committed to getting Brexit done. And as he does so, he will alienate moderate voters.  If the EU does negotiate, Johnson's opponents on the right will be able to legitimately claim that Johnson keeling to Brussels, and he will lose voters to Nigel Farage's Brexit Party.  On the whole, Boris Johnson can judge his first party conference as Prime Minister to have been a success. But it also marked a new phase in the Johnson premiership, as he tries to appeal to moderates, Brexiteers, Conservatives and liberal internationalists alike.  The problem for Johnson is that doing so might be impossible. Eventually, he will need to pick a side.  In his speech, the Prime Minister spoke about his love of buses. Sooner or later, he'll have to throw someone under one.",0
33,Brexiters excitedly repeating ‘we survived The Blitz’ reminded that many people didn’t,33," Blitz spirit Brexiters who repeatedly affirm that Britain will survive a no-deal Brexit because they survived The Blitz have been reminded that there were one or two casualties during that period in time.  With the possibility of a no-deal Brexit looming and increasing fears over food and medicine supplies after March 29th, many Leave voters have taken to telling anyone who will listen that fears are unfounded because Britain survived the Blitz, and therefore the little matter of walking away from one of the largest trading unions in the world is no big deal.  Brexiter Simon Williams, who was born in 1958 and technically therefore didn’t ‘survive’ either of the World Wars took to social to media, saying ,”We survived The Blitz, won two World Wars and beat that German lot once in a game of football.  “I was only eight at the time, and I was drunk when I was watching it so barely remember the game itself, but I’m told it was a complete drubbing of those continental bastards.  “A no-deal Brexit, like The Blitz, might cause a bit of disruption for the first week or so, but no-one will die, mark my words.  “Wait, what’s that? Over forty thousand civilians died in the Blitz? But I thought we won the war? Those statistics are fake news, mate.”  Historian and whingeing remoaner Christopher James told us, “Unfortunately, there is a trend of viewing historical conflicts through rose-tinted glasses, but sometimes the rose tint comes from blood splatters.  “I’m pretty sure those soldiers didn’t fight and give their lives for peace in Europe so their nationalistic offspring could try and tear it all apart again.”",1

Addressing his party conference in Manchester, the PM said his plan would be a ""compromise by the UK"", but he hoped the EU would ""understand that and compromise in their turn"".  The European Commission said they will ""examine [the proposals] objectively"".  The Irish PM said he had not seen the plans but was ""not encouraged"".  Leo Varadker told the Irish Parliament: ""What we are hearing is not encouraging and would not be the basis for agreement.""  The UK is set to leave the EU on 31 October.  The government has insisted it will not negotiate a further delay beyond the Halloween deadline, saying this would be unnecessary and costly for the UK.  However, under the terms of a law passed by Parliament last month, the PM faces having to request another extension unless MPs back the terms of withdrawal by 19 October - two days after a summit of European leaders.  The European Commission's President Jean-Claude Juncker and Mr Johnson will speak on the phone later, and the two sides' negotiating teams will also meet.  In his speech, Mr Johnson said no-deal was not an outcome the government was seeking, but ""it is an outcome for which we are ready"".  On the eve of his speech, Mr Johnson told a conference fringe meeting, hosted by the DUP, that he hoped to reach a deal with the EU over the course of ""the next few days"".  What has the PM proposed?  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption PM: Boris Johnson: ""It (no deal) is not an outcome we want... but is an outcome for which we are ready""  The issue of the Irish border - and how to keep it free from border checks when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU - has been a key sticking point in Brexit negotiations.  Mr Johnson has said the solution reached by the EU and Theresa May, the backstop, is ""anti-democratic"" and ""inconsistent with the sovereignty of the UK"", claiming it offered no means for the UK to unilaterally exit and no say for the people of Northern Ireland over the rules that would apply there.  The PM used his speech to confirm parts of his offer to the EU.  He said that ""under no circumstances"" would there be checks at or near the border in Northern Ireland and the proposals would respect the peace process and the Good Friday agreement.  It included promising ""a process of renewable democratic consent"" for the Stormont Assembly on its relationship with the EU going forward.  He also referred to the use of technological solutions to ensure there was no hard border on the island of Ireland.  He said he did not want a deal to be out of reach ""because of what is essentially a technical discussion of the exact nature of future customs checks when that technology is improving the whole time"".  Mr Johnson also said he would ""protect the existing regulatory arrangements for farmers and other businesses on both sides of the border"".  He added: ""At the same time we will allow the UK - whole and entire - to withdraw from the EU, with control of our own trade policy from the start.""  The PM said this would ""protect the union"".  Echoing the main slogan of the conference, Mr Johnson said: ""Let's get Brexit done on 31 October…to answer the cry of those 17.4 million who voted for Brexit [and] for those millions who may have voted Remain, but are first and foremost democrats and accept the result of the referendum.""  He said the Tories were ""not an anti-European party"" and the UK is ""not an anti-European country"".  The PM added: ""We love Europe. We are European.  ""But after 45 years of really dramatic constitutional change, we must have a new relationship with the EU.""  This speech was hugely important for Boris Johnson's Brexit deal.  Be in no doubt that amongst those listening most closely, most intently, will be leaders in other European capitals, trying to gauge whether Mr Johnson is serious about a Brexit deal or whether he is paving the way for no-deal and looking to blame the EU.  This was actually a rather surprising speech because there was none of the aggressive, combative language that we had been expecting - none of the in your face, take it or leave it final offer that we were told would form the guts of his argument.  Instead, it seemed Mr Johnson went out of his way to adopt a rather more emollient approach, saying how much he loved Europe, how the Tory Party wasn't an anti-European party and how Britain wasn't an anti-European country.  What that meant was that Mr Johnson didn't endeavour to bring the house down in the conference hall. He didn't go for the easy Brussels bashing, and for the wider viewers in this country, there were no brand new policy announcements.  You sense Mr Johnson has calculated for the next few hours and days that the really crucial audience in terms of his premiership, and for his future, is not here in Manchester - it's in capitals around the EU.  What does the EU think?  Image copyright Reuters  Before Mr Johnson's speech, a European Commission spokeswoman said they would examine the proposals objectively, adding: ""We will listen carefully to the UK.""  She said the EU wanted to agree a deal with the UK, saying ""an orderly withdrawal is far more preferable than a 'no-deal' scenario"".  But the spokeswoman also reminded the UK of its ""well-known criteria"", saying: ""In order for there to be a deal, we must have a legally operational solution that meets all the objectives of the backstop.  ""[That means] preventing a hard border, preserving North-South cooperation and the all-island economy, and protecting the EU's Single Market and Ireland's place in it.""  Leo Varadker said he would work until the last moment to secure an agreement, but he added: ""We will not do so at any cost, and we are ready for no-deal if that's what the British decide to do.""  The BBC's Europe editor, Katya Adler said the bloc wanted to do a deal and needed to be seen to try.  But she added it was ""fundamentally misunderstanding the EU"" if the prime minister believed the other 26 EU leaders will turn round to Ireland and say they have to accept the proposals just they want to have a deal.  What has been the reaction to his speech?  Image copyright PA Media  There were huge rounds of applause for Mr Johnson from within the conference hall, showing support from his party.  After the speech, one member said the PM was ""exactly what we need"", while another said she had been ""inspired"", adding: ""We are so fed up with nothing happening, but we feel like something will happen now because we think he will deliver.""  Leaving the hall, Tory MP Mims Davies described her leader as ""bombastic Boris"", saying: ""That [speech] was a message to the country, a message to our party and a message to the EU - we are ready to get on with this.""  But the PM's plan has been branded as ""extreme"" and ""doomed to failure"" by the SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, who said his strategy was leading towards a no-deal.  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the prime minister's speech was ""absolute bluster"" and he described it as a ""cynical manipulation to get a no-deal"".  Mr McDonnell also that any Brexit deal or no-deal should be put to the people to make the final decision.  The director general of the CBI, Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, praised the PM's ""optimistic vision for the UK"".  But she said his plan ""relies on a good Brexit deal"".  ""The UK is at a crossroads,"" she said. ""[And] the no-deal turning ends in a very different place: a swamp that will slow the UK's every step for years to come.""  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Boris Johnson: ""If Parliament were a reality TV show... the whole lot of us would've been voted out of the jungle""  What else did Mr Johnson say in his speech?  Image copyright PA Media  The PM also used the opportunity to criticise Parliament, saying it ""refuses to deliver Brexit, refuses to do anything constructive and refuses to have an election"".  He said: ""I am afraid that after three and a half years people are beginning to feel that they are being taken for fools.""  Mr Johnson said the Tories were ""the party of the NHS"" because of their belief in capitalism, adding: ""We understand the vital symmetry at the heart of the modern British economy between a dynamic enterprise culture and great public services precisely because we are the party of capitalism.""  He praised London as its former mayor, but pledged to ""unlock talent in every corner of the UK"", and ensure safety with his existing policies of 20,000 additional police officers and tackling county lines gangs.  And he repeated more policy announcements from the conference on infrastructure, education, law and order.  Mr Johnson concluded: ""Let's get on with sensible moderate one nation but tax-cutting Tory government and, figuratively if not literally, let us send Jeremy Corbyn into orbit where he belongs.  ""Let's get Brexit done [and] let's bring our country together.""  Mr Johnson's conference speech clashed with Prime Minister's Questions.

19,brexit countdown_bg Created with Sketch.,19," MPs will vote today on whether to allow the Commons to take three days off next week, barely a day after politicians returned to Westminster.  After the furious row over Boris Johnson's overruled attempt to prorogue Parliament, his Government will try to force through a short recess from Monday to Wednesday next week so the Conservative Party Conference can go ahead as planned.  But with a febrile atmosphere in the Commons he faces a difficult task getting it approved.  Mr Johnson is also thought to be plotting a fresh attempt at prorogation that would be legally watertight enough to avoid being overturned in another humiliating court battle.  Why does the Government want a recess?  After the furious row over Boris Johnson's overruled attempt to prorogue Parliament, his Government will try to force through a short recess from Monday to Wednesday next week  In normal times the Commons votes to have a short recess in the autumn to allow the parties' annual conferences to go ahead unimpeded.  Recesses are essentially fixed-length halts in the parliamentary term and take place after a vote by MPs.  It means Ministers and shadow ministers do not find themselves having to be in two places and blocks political chicanery from taking place in the absence of one party.  But these are not normal times. Boris Johnson's plan to prorogue Parliament - call an end to the current session and start another following a Queen's Speech - meant the recess vote never took place.  After the Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that Boris Johnson had acted unlawfully and prorogation was null and void, MPs found themselves back in the Commons with no conference recess agreed.  This was fine for Labour and the Lib Dems, who have had their events already.  But the Conservatives are due to descend on Manchester from Sunday, with Boris Johnson due to address the party faithful on Wednesday.  Without a recess that speech will clash with his appearance at Prime Minister's Questions.  More importantly, ministers fear that opposition parties will use the absence of Tory MPs for political ends - forcing them to come back to London at short notice to answer urgent questions and make statements - or even force votes on Brexit related measures.  The Tories have made clear they will press on with the conference despite the turmoil. The event is a major money-spinner for the party and cancelling would leave a big dent in its finances just months before an expected election.  Commons' Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg last night confirmed that he would seek to force a recess in a vote this afternoon.  Whether it succeeds rests on the attitude of 21 former Tory MPs who lost the whip after voting against the Government but remain Tory party members. If they fall into line it could pass, narrowly.  But how can Boris Johnson prorogue Parliament AGAIN after his court defeat?  Mr Johnson (pictured last night) has made clear that he wants to deliver a fresh Queen's Speech and had previously set a date of October 14.  Boris Johnson is believed to be planning to suspend Parliament again as he tries to hold a Queen's Speech so that his government can set out its domestic legislative agenda.  The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that his five-week suspension of Parliament was unlawful.  But the court did suggest that a shorter prorogation of four or five days would be acceptable.  It said that such a period of time was normal for prorogation purposes.  Downing Street is still examining the court's judgement but there is growing speculation that Number 10 could move to prorogue Parliament again in the coming days.  Any move to suspend Parliament would be massively controversial given that MPs have only just returned to work.  But the government will be hopeful that a shorter prorogation would not fall foul of the courts.  Mr Johnson has made clear that he wants to deliver a fresh Queen's Speech and had previously set a date of October 14.  But the timing of when a prorogation order could be made is yet to be set out.  It is thought that the timing could be impacted by the outcome of the recess vote this afternoon.  If MPs reject the Conservatives' request for the recess it may well act as the trigger for Mr Johnson to try to shut Parliament sooner rather than later.  How will the Remainers try to thwart Boris's Brexit plans?  Rebel MPs are plotting firm action designed to hem in the Prime Minister over Brexit.  But there is an apparent split between the Lib Dems and ex-Tories over whether they should try to strengthen an anti-No Deal law designed to force Boris Johnson to delay Brexit.  Under the so-called Benn Act passed at the start of the month Mr Johnson will have to go to Brussels on October 19 and beg for a three-month Article 50 extension if he has not agreed an exit deal with the EU by then.  But with the PM insisting Brexit will still happen on Halloween, with or without a deal, Remainers fear he is preparing to break the law.  Some are worried that the current legislation to force his hand might may not be strong enough and want to make it 'bulletproof'.  The Lib Dems are leading the charge and want to bring forward new rebel legislation which would force the PM to ask for a delay long before the middle of October - perhaps as early as next week.  But the 21 ex-Tory MPs are against tampering with the existing law. Instead they want to use the time between now and October to hold the Prime Minister's feet to the fire in different ways.  Forcing Boris to ask for Brexit delay from EU with a new law blocking No Deal  Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said yesterday that the Benn Act, an emergency law passed weeks ago forcing Boris Johnson to seek an extension to Article 50, needed strengthening.  It is due to take effect from October 19 if there is no deal in place, mandating an application for a three-month Brexit delay. Government sources have suggested Mr Johnson might try to ignore it.  In a jibe at the Prime Minister following his Supreme Court defeat yesterday Ms Swinson said: 'We simply cannot afford to wait until the 19th of October to see whether or not the Prime Minister will refuse to obey the law again.'  Using Parliamentary rules to take control of the Commons  Ideas floating about include using emergency debate powers to seize control of the order paper, or use a 'humble address' to force the Government to release more Brexit documents.  Some MPs are reportedly planning to try to force the government to publish its prorogation legal advice from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox in full.  The Remain-backing MPs know they have a majority in the Commons and could also try to reinforce the recently passed anti-No Deal law to make it 'bullet proof' amid suggestions the PM could try to ignore it.  Supporters of a so-called 'People's Vote' will be considering whether they could use the shifting balance of power in Westminster to secure their goal.  Labour currently supports a second referendum, but only after an election.  Find Mr Johnson in contempt of Parliament  They could also make moves to find Mr Johnson in contempt of Parliament. Without a majority the PM can in effect do very little to stop them.  Action could be taken against Mr Johnson over his illegal advice to the Queen, with the possibility of contempt proceedings. Theoretically this could include stripping him of his salary - or even imprisoning him at Parliament, although the latter seems very unlikely.  It has also been suggested that MPs could put Theresa May's deal back on the table, but try to attach a 'confirmatory vote' or second referendum.  They could also possibly try to dictate the negotiating strategy of the government, by passing laws instructing them to seek certain terms.  A vote of No Confidence in the Prime Minister  Jeremy Corbyn, pictured on stage in Brighton at Labour conference immediately after the Supreme Court ruling, said Mr Johnson must now 'consider his position'  Such a vote, which could bring down the Government, seems unlikely to be held immediately.  Mr Johnson laid down the gauntlet to opposition parties last night as he said that if any of them wanted to try to topple him then he would make time tomorrow for a vote of no confidence to take place.  That vote would only require a simple majority to succeed and it would then trigger a 14 day period in which another government could be formed.  If no one was able to command a majority in the Commons at the end of that period it would prompt an election to be held after a 25 day campaign period - likely at the end of November.  The responsibility for seeking a vote of no confidence has so far rested with Mr Corbyn as the leader of the opposition, and he has said it will not happen until after the 'threat of No Deal is taken off the table'.  That date that could be as late as October 19, because they want a No Deal Brexit to be ruled out before they push for a vote. A No Confidence vote it could lead to a general election, which sees parliament shut down for five weeks of campaigning, meaning there would be a risk of an accidental hard Brexit if it was triggered too early.  Mr Corbyn said today: 'Until it is very clear that the application will be made, per the legislation, to the EU to extend our membership to at least January, then we will continue pushing for that (blocking No Deal) and that is our priority.'  He added: 'When that has been achieved we will then be ready with a motion of no confidence.'  The vote would almost certainly be tight. Mr Johnson would expect to count on the support of the overwhelming majority of Tory MPs although today's Supreme Court ruling could make some think long and hard about backing the PM.  Mr Johnson would also likely be supported by a number of Labour Brexit-backing MPs as well as the DUP.  On the other side, if Mr Corbyn was to launch a push to get rid of Mr Johnson he would likely only do so if he believed all the other opposition parties were on board.  Lib Dem sources have suggested they could now back a vote of no confidence while the SNP would leap at any opportunity to boot out Mr Johnson.  The parliamentary arithmetic means that the result could ultimately come down to how a group of 21 Tory rebels who were stripped of the whip by the PM after backing the anti-No Deal law would vote.  Block a general election before Brexit Day on October 31  The ruling represents a major set back for Mr Johnson, pictured in New York today, who is now facing calls to resign. He said he believes the court made the wrong decision  The Prime Minister wants to have an election as soon as possible and has tried to call one twice, using the Fixed Term Parliament Act (FTPA), but was voted down by the opposition.  They know they hold the trump card, just as they do on the No Confidence vote, and will strike when it decides the time is right.  Despite spending months demanding a general election Mr Corbyn will delay until a No Deal Brexit is ruled out before acquiescing.  It means the election everyone knows is coming is unlikely to be before November or December, with some in Labour suggesting they could hold off until the spring.  But the 21 Tory rebels DON'T want to play ball. What do they want to do instead?  Meanwhile, the 21 Tory MPs who were stripped of the whip are believed to be opposed to Ms Swinson's proposals.  They reportedly favour leaving the anti-No Deal law as it is and concentrating instead on ramping up the scrutiny of the PM's Brexit plans.  It is thought the 21 former Tories want to use parliamentary procedures and arcane devices to force the government to publish more details of its No Deal contingency planning and to keep the pressure on the PM with urgent questions and debates.  Such methods have proved productive for rebel MPs in the past as they have previously forced the government to hand over Brexit economic impact assessments and No Deal documents.",0
42,"Boris Johnson just outlined his final, take it or leave it pitch for a Brexit deal to the European Union Wednesday, warning that if the bloc didn’t work with him, Britain was fully prepared to leave with no deal.",42," But the prime minister's plan, published on Twitter, is so far off the mark that it looks like a deliberate attempt to sabotage any deal.  Even before the British government submitted its proposal to EU headquarters in Brussels, Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said that a leaked version of the plans did not “look like the basis for an agreement,” and suggested it might not even be a serious attempt to reach an agreement.  Before tweeting out the five-point proposal, Johnson outlined his plan in a speech to members of his Conservative Party in Manchester, saying no deal wasn’t the outcome his government wanted, but “it is an outcome for which we are ready.” Britain is scheduled to leave the EU on Oct. 31, and Johnson has said the country will leave, deal or no deal.  In an effort to sidestep opposition from MPs, he took the extraordinary step last month of suspending Parliament for a five-week period ahead of the Brexit deadline. But Britain’s Supreme Court ruled that the suspension was politically motivated and therefore illegal, dealing a major blow to his strategy.  An alternative to the ‘backstop’  The most contentious sticking point in negotiations with the EU has been the status of the Irish border, dividing Northern Ireland, part of the UK, with the Republic of Ireland, an EU state.  Negotiations have stalled on questions surrounding customs and regulatory arrangements along the border — the only land border that the UK will share with the EU after Brexit.  Currently, goods and services flow freely between the two jurisdictions, and the UK and Europe agree there can’t be a return to any border infrastructure separating them. The guarantee of an open border was crucial to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which brought an end to the 30 years of sectarian conflict known as the Troubles.  Security officials believe that any new physical infrastructure in Northern Ireland would become targets for sectarian violence and fuel regional tensions. There are also concerns from business that customs checks would disrupt cross-border trade, worth about £5 billion ($6.2 billion).  A previous draft Brexit deal reached by Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, with the EU had proposed a so-called backstop as a solution, in which Britain would stay in the customs union until a new trade deal with the EU had been agreed. But this was rejected by members of May’s Conservative government, including Johnson, who said it was “inconsistent with the sovereignty of the UK"" and feared it could lead to Britain becoming trapped in the customs union indefinitely.  Johnson, who is determined to find an alternative to the backstop, said he would offer to keep Northern Ireland in the European single market for goods but leave the EU customs union, along with the rest of the UK, after a transition period.  That would require some customs checks to be introduced — a measure he argued could be alleviated through introducing new systems including electronic paperwork, and a “very small number” of physical checks.  Johnson said that customs checks were “just a reality,” but insisted that these would not be at the border. “We will under no circumstances have checks at or near the border in Northern Ireland. We will respect the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement,” he said.  Not even close, says Ireland  While Johnson framed his proposals as a compromise, and said he hoped his negotiating partners in Europe would “understand that and compromise in their turn,” initial indications weren’t promising. The imposition of customs checks between Ireland and Northern Ireland are a longstanding red line for the EU.  The European Commission said Wednesday it would examine the proposals objectively, but Coveney, Ireland’s foreign minister and deputy prime minister, said the proposal didn’t look like a promising basis for negotiation.  He said his government’s position had consistently held there be “no physical border infrastructure on the island of Ireland, and no related checks or controls.”  “The idea that you would be putting a customs border effectively between Northern Ireland and the Republic is not something that is consistent with that, or even close.”  He suggested the proposals were so far off the mark that they may not be a genuine attempt to reach a deal.  “If there is a proposal that involves customs checks on the island of Ireland, that in itself is bad faith given the commitments the British government has given both to Ireland and the EU over the last three years,"" he said.  British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn was also scathing of the proposal, saying the proposed alternative to the backstop was ""worse than Theresa May's deal.”  He claimed that Johnson knew “full well that what he's put forward is unlikely to be agreed,” saying the prime minister appeared intent on a no-deal Brexit.  Johnson is due to speak with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to discuss the proposals later Wednesday, with the clock ticking before the UK is scheduled to leave the EU at the end of the month. Under the terms of a law passed by Parliament last month, Johnson is obliged to ask the EU for another extension unless MPs back the terms of withdrawal by Oct. 19. But he's insisted he will not do so.  Cover: Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivers his Leader's speech at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester, England, Wednesday, Oct. 2, 2019.

""It was never something that could get her killed.""  She adds: ""I am scared when I scroll through the replies to her tweets calling her a liar and a traitor.  ""I am scared when our house gets fitted with panic buttons, industrial-locking doors and explosive bags to catch the mail.  ""I am scared because on the 16th of June 2016, two children said goodbye to their mother before she left for her constituency to sit in surgeries and help people all day, and never saw her again.  ""I am scared every single day that the same will happen to mine.""  Image copyright PA Media Image caption Ed Balls, who was an MP until 2015, and Yvette Cooper when they were both in cabinet in 2010  Ms Cooper said ""of course people have strong opinions"" but called on Mr Johnson to ""take a stand"" to call for an end to ""inflammatory and aggressive language"".  She described the scenes in the House of Commons on Wednesday - which was the first time MPs had returned to Parliament since it was prorogued - as ""chilling"".  The debate descended into rowdiness on Wednesday evening, with several MPs criticising the prime minister for his language and urging him to refrain from using words like ""surrender"".  Mr Johnson had called the legislation which aims to block a no-deal Brexit a ""surrender bill"".  The prime minister has also been urged to apologise for saying the best way to honour Ms Cox - who was killed in Birstall, West Yorkshire in 2016 - was to ""get Brexit done"".  Brendan Cox, the husband of Ms Cox, also said he had been shocked by the language used and the Brexit debate had become a ""bear pit of polarisation"".  Mr Johnson has refused to apologise for his language.  In an interview with the BBC, Mr Johnson defended his words and insisted he ""deplores any threats to anybody, particularly female MPs"" and said ""tempers need to come down"" in Parliament.  When asked if he was apologising for his language, he said: ""Obviously I'm deeply sorry for the threats that MPs face and I think it's very important we look after them, particularly look after female MPs.""  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Johnson ""deplores threats"" against MPs but doesn't apologise for his use of language  He added that the death of Jo Cox was an ""absolute tragedy"".  ""But it's also important to protect the right of MPs to speak freely in the House of Commons about important political matters and the fact of the so-called Benn Act is that it surrenders our powers,"" he added.  Tory chairman James Cleverly has called criticism of the PM ""deeply unfair"".  He said the debate over Brexit in the House of Commons had generated ""a huge amount of temper on both sides"", adding: ""The best thing we can do to calm things down is to get it delivered, get it resolved.""",0
37,"I will deliver Brexit by thoroughly pissing off the people who will carry it out, says Boris Johnson",37," Boris Johnson and the civil service Boris Johnson has taken a vital first step in the process of leaving the EU by completely alienating the staff he will depend on to get anything done, should he get into Downing Street.  Simon Williams MP, a gout-afflicted cretin that support Boris Johnson, explained that enraging the people who know every little dirty secret and control all the machinery of government was a brilliant tactical play.  He went on, “The highly professional global network created by the FCO over decades will be essential to obtain the trade deals and political concessions the UK will need if it wants to still be in the G20 this time next year.  “That’s why wily Boris has shown the diplomats who run this network that he will trash their career just to get a thumbs up from a thin-skinned sexual predator.  “A little kick up the backside for the Sir Humphreys out there. It’s not like they have any way of retaliating. Because if there’s one person who has nothing to worry about from government leaks, it’s Boris.”  Many people on the left were also rejoicing at the new dynamics between the Tory leadership and Whitehall, as explained Amanda Tinnock, political editor for the Guardian newspaper.  “I think we are going to enter a golden age of open government when Boris becomes PM. I suspect every single tiny fuck-up and tawdry detail will somehow find its way to a front-page within hours.  “Even better, since Boris couldn’t organise a piss up in a brewery, if the mandarins don’t play along then Brexit is fucked.”",1
44,"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged the European Union to compromise as he prepares to put forward what he called ""constructive and reasonable proposals"" to Brussels to resolve the Brexit deadlock.",44," Addressing the Conservative Party conference on Wednesday, Johnson warned that the country was ready to leave without a deal on October 31 if no agreement was reached - even though he is compelled by law to seek a deadline extension in the case of such an event.  The prime minister insisted his plan to replace the Irish backstop, which involves a customs union between the United Kingdom and the bloc in order to avoid a hard Irish border, would ""in no circumstances"" result in checks at or near the border of Northern Ireland - though he did not define ""near"".  ""Today in Brussels we are tabling what I believe are constructive and reasonable proposals which provide a compromise for both sides,"" he told the party faithful in Manchester, having skipped what have certainly been a hostile House of Commons at Prime Minister's Questions.  ""We will under no circumstances have checks at or near the border in Northern Ireland. We will respect the peace process and the Good Friday agreement,"" he said, referring to a 1998 deal that ended decades of violence.  ""And by a process of renewable democratic consent by the executive and assembly of Northern Ireland we will go further and protect the existing regulatory arrangements for farmers and other businesses on both sides of the border.  ""And at the same time, we will allow the UK - whole and entire - to withdraw from the EU, with control of our own trade policy from the start.""  Johnson will speak to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday afternoon, but the commission said it would not ""pre-empt any reaction"" before having a chance to study the proposals to replace the backstop, which was a part of a deal the EU reached with Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May.  'Compromise'  Johnson said his ""plan"" - on which the speech itself was light on detail - represented a ""compromise by the UK"".  ""I hope very much that our friends understand that and compromise in their turn,"" he told the conference.  ""Because if we fail to get an agreement because of what is essentially a technical discussion of the exact nature of future customs checks, when that technology is improving the whole time, then let us be in no doubt that the alternative is no deal.  ""That is not an outcome we want. It is not an outcome we seek at all. But ... it is an outcome for which we are ready.""  Not one border but two  British officials have described the texts being presented to the EU as a ""final offer"" - but observers say Johnson is hoping to start a new conversation.  190929085456972  ""Crucially, both the ERG [an influential Tory Eurosceptic faction] and the DUP [Northern Irish conservatives] are on board with this new Brexit plan,"" tweeted Sebastian Payne, the Financial Times Whitehall correspondent. ""No10 hopes to use this unity to show the EU that if they engage with the Brexit proposals, a deal can get through Parliament.""  The plan, according to leaked reports, involves creating not one hard border, but two ""soft"" borders - a regulatory border between Britain and Northern Ireland in the Irish Sea for four years and customs checks between the North and the Irish Republic.  For decades before the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, customs posts have been targeted by Republican hardliners. Their presence provides a tangible representation of armed British forces on the island of Ireland. The worry is that attacks on customs checkpoints would lead to the British military being deployed to defend them, and the whole spiral of violence then beginning again.  Simon Coveney, Ireland's deputy prime minister, said late on Tuesday that Johnson's idea was ""no basis for an agreement"", calling it ""concerning, to say the least"".  Targeting opposition  In Manchester, Johnson told the conference that people felt they were being ""taken for fools"" by Westminster's failure to honour the result of the 2016 referendum and warned of ""grave consequences"" if Brexit was not delivered.  Moving away from Brexit, Johnson trumpeted the achievements and potential of British industry, citing the UK's national nuclear fusion research centre, and saying how it was ""on the verge"" of supplying nuclear fusion energy to the world. Fusion, the process which powers the sun, is considered the ""holy grail"" of energy sources, and experts say a breakthrough which would lead to commercial distribution is decades away.  Johnson also failed to mention that the research centre, at Culham in Oxfordshire, is part-funded by the EU's EuroFusion consortium, with the Euratom agency funding the landmark, world-leading JET project in its entirety.  190722183952925  He went on to insist the Conservatives were ""the party of the NHS"" while also solving ""the problem of social care"", although he did not set out how. The National Health Service (NHS) was founded by in 1948 by a Labour government - Labour is now the country's main opposition party and is led by Jeremy Corbyn.  During his keynote speech, Johnson branded Corbyn's Labour a party of ""fratricidal, anti-Semitic Marxists"".  ""If Jeremy Corbyn were allowed into Downing Street, he would whack up your taxes, he would foul up the economy, he would rip up the alliance between Britain and the USA and he would break up the UK,"" Johnson said. ""We cannot allow it to happen.""  Corbyn wants to increase taxes on corporations and high earners, nationalise water, gas and rail companies, strengthen trade unions and hand 10 percent of company shares to workers.  A new poll of 1,011 UK adults by UnHerd Insight found 60 percent are in favour of the nationalisation of rail companies; among Labour voters the figure rise to more than 80 percent. There is also strong general public support for the nationalisation of water (55 percent), electricity (52 percent) and gas (51 percent).  'I'm a Celebrity'  Back in the conference hall in Manchester, Johnson ranted against parliament, which he unlawfully suspended last month after a series of humiliating defeats, before the highest court in the land unanimously forced the legislature's reopening, delivering another blow to the prime minister.  If Parliament were a school, inspectors ""would be shutting it down"", and if it were a reality TV show ""the whole lot of us would have been voted out of the jungle,"" he said.  ""The sad truth is that voters have more say over I'm a Celebrity than they do over this House of Commons,"" Johnson added.  The prime minister has lost his ability to govern through Parliament after sacking a ""rebel alliance"" of 21 MPs who voted against the government on the bill which compels the prime minister to seek a Brexit extension.",0
27,"Boris Johnson calls mum a shitter, slams bedroom door and refuses to come down for dinner",27," Boris Johnson Horrible spoilt little boy Boris Johnson has called his mum a ‘big shitter’, stormed up to his bedroom, slammed the door and refused to come down for dinner unless he gets what he wants.  “I can’t understand it,” said his mum, as Boris shouted down from his room that he hated everyone, then slammed the door and turned his music up.  “He’s normally such a nice boy.”  However, his sister revealed that the behaviour wasn’t uncharacteristic.  “He can come over as quite nice, but he’s always been a bit of a shit,” she revealed.  “He once stole a Mars bar from Ackbar’s multi mart in the village and then when Mr Ackbar called mum to complain, Boris told everyone he was a paedophile and a terrorist.  “He always spies on me in the shower and even called nana an old shitbag at her funeral.  “People keep letting him off, though, just because he’s quite good at telling jokes. It’s really annoying.”  Boris is currently maintaining his protest by occasionally opening his bedroom window and shouting ‘it’s not fair, let me do what whatever I want’ at anyone who’ll listen.  It is understood that if he still can’t get what he wants by tomorrow, he plans to poo his own pants because he’s ‘in charge and can do what he likes.’",1
